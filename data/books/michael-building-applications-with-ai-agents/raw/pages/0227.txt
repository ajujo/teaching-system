CHAPTER 9
Validation and Measurement
It has never been easier to build products and applications, but effectively measuring
these systems remains an enormous challenge. While teams are often under pressure
to ship things quickly, taking the time to rigorously evaluate performance and assess
quality pays long-term dividends and enables teams to ultimately move faster and
with more confidence. Without rigorous evaluation and measurement, decisions
about which changes to ship become much more difficult. Rigorous measurement
and validation become essential, not only to optimize performance but also to build
trust and ensure alignment with user expectations.
This chapter explores methodologies for evaluating agent-based systems, covering
key principles, measurement techniques, and validation strategies. We explore the
critical role of defining clear objectives, selecting appropriate metrics, and imple‐
menting robust testing frameworks to assess system performance under real-world
conditions. Beyond mere functionality, the reliability of agent outputs—including
accuracy, consistency, coherence, and responsiveness—requires systematic scrutiny,
particularly given the probabilistic nature of foundation models that often power
these systems.
Throughout this chapter, we follow a customer support agent handling a common
ecommerce scenario: a customer reports a cracked coffee mug and requests a refund.
We’ll build on this case, exploring variations like multi-item orders, cancellations, or
changes in addresses, to illustrate measurement, validation, and deployment.
Measuring Agentic Systems
Without rigorous measurement, it is impossible to ensure that the system meets its
intended goals or handles the complexities of real-world environments. By defining
clear objectives, establishing relevant metrics, and employing systematic evaluation
