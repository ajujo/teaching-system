For example, an agent managing a workflow might use a dashboard to show pending
tasks, completed steps, and error notifications, enabling users to quickly understand
the system’s state at a glance. Tools like LangSmith, n8n, Arize, and AutoGen are
beginning to illustrate agent workflows visually, making them easier to understand,
debug, and reason about; we are likely to see much more of this visual orchestration
in the future. To see how these graphical orchestration interfaces are emerging in
practice, Figure 3-2 shows an example of a modern agent workflow builder. Tools like
this illustrate agent actions, tool calls, conditionals, and outputs as connected visual
nodes, enabling developers and operators to easily understand, debug, and optimize
complex agentic flows without stepping through raw code alone.
Figure 3-2. Visual orchestration of an agent workflow in n8n.io. This interface displays
an AI agent integrated with multiple tools, models, and structured parsing components
arranged in a node-based workflow. Such visual designs make it easier to build, man‐
age, and iterate on multistep agent pipelines at scale.
