Figure 3-4. The autonomy slider enables users to adjust an agent’s level of independence,
ranging from fully manual control, to assisted “Ask” mode, to fully autonomous agent
execution. This flexibility builds user trust by aligning system behavior with user prefer‐
ences, task complexity, and context.
Different users, tasks, and contexts demand different degrees of agent autonomy. In
some situations, users prefer full manual control to ensure precision, while in others,
they may want to offload routine or complex tasks entirely to the agent. Critically,
these preferences are not static; they evolve with user trust, task familiarity, stakes,
and workload. For example:
Manual
The developer writes all code themselves without agent assistance. The IDE acts
purely as an editor with syntax highlighting and linting but no AI-driven
suggestions.
Ask (assisted)
The agent proactively suggests code completions, refactors, or documentation
snippets, but the developer reviews and accepts each suggestion before it is
applied. This mode speeds up development while keeping the human fully in
control.
Agent
The agent autonomously performs certain tasks, such as applying standard refac‐
tors, fixing linter errors, or generating boilerplate code files based on project con‐
ventions without requiring individual approvals. The developer is notified of
changes but does not need to approve each action.
These three modes demonstrate how an autonomy slider empowers developers to
balance control and efficiency within a single interface. The same principle applies
beyond software development. For example, in a customer support platform:
Manual
Human agents handle all incoming customer queries themselves. The AI is inac‐
tive or used only for backend analytics, not frontline interactions.
Ask (assisted)
The agent drafts suggested replies to customer messages, surfacing recom‐
mended responses, policy references, or troubleshooting steps. The human agent
