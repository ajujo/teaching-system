Figure 3-1. AI-enabled terminal interface. A demonstration of an AI-augmented termi‐
nal, where natural language inputs are interpreted into executable commands. Such
interfaces transform the traditional command line into an intelligent conversational
partner for system operations and development workflows.
However, a key limitation of text-based interfaces is discoverability. Users often do
not know what capabilities the agent supports or how to phrase commands effec‐
tively. Unlike graphical interfaces—where options, buttons, and menus visually indi‐
cate what actions are possible—text-based interfaces require users to guess or recall
available functionalities. This lack of affordances can lead to confusion, underutiliza‐
tion of agent capabilities, and user frustration when their requests fall outside the
agent’s supported scope. For example, a user might ask a support chatbot to modify
an order detail that the system does not support, receiving an opaque rejection rather
than guidance toward what is possible.
