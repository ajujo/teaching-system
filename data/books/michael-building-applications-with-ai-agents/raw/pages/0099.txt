the 1969 Apollo 11 mission.
One of the most impressive things about Buzz Aldrin is that he was the Lunar 
Module Eagle pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, making him one of the first 
two humans to land on the Moon. This historic event marked a significant 
achievement in space exploration and human history. Additionally, Aldrin made 
three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission, showcasing his tools 
and contributions to advancing space travel.
Let’s now look at a second example, for an agent that is designed to fetch and display
stock market data. This process involves defining the API interaction, handling the
response, and integrating the tool into the agent’s workflow. By following this
approach, agents can integrate external data sources seamlessly, enhancing their over‐
all functionality and effectiveness.
First, we define the function that interacts with the stock market API. Then, we regis‐
ter this function as a tool for our agent, and we can then invoke it just like the previ‐
ous tools:
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_community.tools import WikipediaQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
import requests
@tool
def get_stock_price(ticker: str) -> float:
   """Get the stock price for the stock exchange ticker for the company."""
   api_url = f"https://api.example.com/stocks/{ticker}"
   response = requests.get(api_url)
   if response.status_code == 200:
       data = response.json()
       return data["price"]
   else:
       raise ValueError(f"Failed to fetch stock price for {ticker}")
# Initialize the LLM with GPT-4o and bind the tools
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([get_stock_price])
messages = [HumanMessage("What is the stock price of Apple?")]
ai_msg = llm_with_tools.invoke(messages)
messages.append(ai_msg)
for tool_call in ai_msg.tool_calls:
   tool_msg = get_stock_price.invoke(tool_call)
  
   print(tool_msg.name)
   print(tool_call['args'])
