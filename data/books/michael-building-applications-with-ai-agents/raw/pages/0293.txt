CHAPTER 12
Protecting Agentic Systems
The adoption of AI agents introduces unique security challenges distinct from tradi‐
tional software. Agentic systems—characterized by their autonomy, advanced reason‐
ing capabilities, dynamic interactions, and complex workflows—significantly expand
the threat landscape. Effectively securing these systems requires addressing not only
traditional security concerns but also unique vulnerabilities inherent to agent
autonomy, probabilistic decision making, and extensive reliance on foundational AI
models and data.
Generative AI has introduced a formidable and expanding threat vector in the cyber‐
security landscape. These technologies amplify risks through sophisticated attacks
like deepfakes for fraud, prompt injections to hijack systems, and memory poisoning
in multiagent workflows, where tainted data can cascade into systemic failures or
unauthorized actions. For instance, in early 2025, a Maine municipality fell victim to
an AI-powered phishing scam that exploited generative voice cloning to steal
between $10,000 and $100,000, while the Chevrolet dealership’s chatbot was manipu‐
lated via prompt injection to offer a $76,000 vehicle for just $1, highlighting how
easily safeguards can be bypassed. Similarly, agentic systems have exposed new vul‐
nerabilities, as seen in Google’s Big Sleep agent uncovering a zero-day flaw in SQLite
(CVE-2025-6965), but also raising concerns over autonomous agents potentially
escalating privileges or drifting from objectives in enterprise. With Gartner predicting
that over 40% of AI-related data breaches by 2027 will stem from cross-border gener‐
ative AI misuse, and 73% of enterprises already reporting AI security incidents aver‐
aging $4.8 million each, addressing these threats is imperative through robust
governance, real-time monitoring, and layered defenses to harness AI’s potential
without compromising security.
This chapter serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and mitigating the
risks associated with agentic systems. It begins by exploring the unique security
