When designed thoughtfully, text-based agents are reliable, adaptable, and deeply
useful across a wide range of contexts. For example, text-based agents might be ideal
for chat interfaces over messaging apps—like Slack, Teams, and WhatsApp for scal‐
able communications with customers or employees—or text-heavy workloads like
customer service, claims processing, or textual research tasks. Their accessibility and
ease of deployment make them a cornerstone of agentic UX design—provided their
limitations (particularly around discoverability) are mitigated through clear commu‐
nication of capabilities, robust error handling, and a focus on seamless conversational
flow.
Graphical Interfaces
Graphical interfaces offer users a visual and interactive way to engage with agent sys‐
tems, combining text, buttons, icons, and other graphical elements to facilitate com‐
munication. These interfaces are particularly effective for tasks requiring visual
clarity, structured workflows, or multistep processes, where pure text or voice interac‐
tions may fall short. Common examples include dashboard-based AI tools, graphical
chat interfaces, and agent-powered productivity platforms with clickable elements.
The key strength of graphical interfaces lies in their ability to present information vis‐
ually and reduce cognitive load. Humans primarily rely on visual input and can pro‐
cess visual information more quickly and easily than text-based information. Well-
designed interfaces can display complex data, status updates, or task progress in an
intuitive and digestible format. Visual cues, such as progress bars, color coding, and
alert icons, guide users effectively without requiring lengthy explanations.
