What This Book Is Not
This book isn’t an introduction to AI or ML basics. It assumes familiarity with con‐
cepts like neural networks, natural language processing, and basic programming in
languages like Python. If you’re new to these, pointers to resources are provided, but
the focus is on applied agent building.
It’s also not a step-by-step tutorial for specific tools, as technologies evolve rapidly.
Instead, it offers guidance on evaluating and selecting tools, with pseudocode and
examples to illustrate concepts. For hands-on implementation, online tutorials and
documentation are recommended, including frameworks like LangChain and
AutoGen.
Who This Book Is For
This book is for engineers, developers, and technical leaders aiming to build AI
agent-based applications. It’s geared toward roles like AI engineers, software develop‐
ers, ML engineers, data scientists, and product managers with a technical bent. You
might relate to scenarios like the following:
• You’re tasked with building an autonomous system for decision support, or inter‐
active services.
• You have a working agent prototype and you want to harden it and get it ready
for production.
• Your team struggles with agent reliability—handling failures, adapting to
dynamic environments, or orchestrating complex tasks—and you want system‐
atic approaches including orchestration, memory, and learning from experience.
• You’re integrating agents into existing workflows and seek best practices for scal‐
ability, multiagent coordination, UX design, measurement, validation, monitor‐
ing, and security.
You can also benefit if you’re a tool builder identifying gaps in the agent ecosystem, a
researcher exploring applications, or a job seeker preparing for AI agent roles.
Navigating This Book
The chapters follow the lifecycle of building an AI agent application, organized into
three main sections.
The first three chapters cover core concepts, design principles, and essential
components:
