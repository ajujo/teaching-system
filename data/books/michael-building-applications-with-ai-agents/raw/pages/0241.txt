on outdated, incomplete, or poorly vetted data are more prone to generating errone‐
ous information. Testing processes must ensure that the agent consistently draws
from accurate, relevant, and up-to-date sources. For example, an AI summarizing
news articles should rely on credible, well-regarded publications and avoid unverified
sources.
Feedback mechanisms are essential for detecting and addressing hallucination. These
systems monitor the agent’s outputs, flagging inaccuracies for review and correction.
Human-in-the-loop feedback loops can be particularly effective, enabling domain
experts to refine the system’s responses over time. In dynamic applications, automa‐
ted feedback mechanisms can identify discrepancies between the agent’s predictions
and actual outcomes, triggering updates to models or data sources to improve
reliability.
Mitigations for hallucinations have evolved to emphasize hybrid human-AI feedback
loops, where domain experts collaborate with AI systems in real-time oversight—
such as in crisis self-rescue scenarios—to refine outputs, reduce cognitive load on
users, and correct fabrications before they propagate. This approach integrates auto‐
mated detection with human judgment, enhancing reliability in high-stakes applica‐
tions like healthcare or legal advice. Additionally, cost-aware evaluations are gaining
traction, focusing on balancing hallucination reduction with inference expenses; for
instance, frameworks now quantify “hallucination cost” through metrics that weigh
accuracy improvements against computational overhead, enabling more efficient
deployments without sacrificing performance.
By prioritizing content accuracy, enforcing data dependence, leveraging feedback
mechanisms, and rigorously testing for diverse scenarios, developers can minimize
the risk of hallucination and build agents that deliver reliable, grounded, and trust‐
worthy outputs. This disciplined approach ensures that the system operates as a relia‐
ble partner in its intended domain, meeting user expectations and adhering to high 
standards of accuracy and integrity.
Handling Unexpected Inputs
Real-world environments are unpredictable, and agents must be robust in the face of
unanticipated, malformed, or even malicious inputs. Integration tests in this area
intentionally supply inputs that fall outside the training or design assumptions—such
as unexpected data formats, slang or typos in user language, or partial failures of
external services. The goal is to ensure that the agent neither crashes nor produces
harmful outputs, but instead responds gracefully: by clarifying, declining, or escalat‐
ing as appropriate.
In the context of our ecommerce agent, unexpected inputs could include malformed
order IDs (e.g., a typo in “A89268” during a cracked mug refund) or ambiguous
requests blending intents (as in cancel_4_refund, where a cancellation is requested
