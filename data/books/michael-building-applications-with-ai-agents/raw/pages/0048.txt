operate efficiently in dynamic environments and adapt to new situations based on
historical data. We’ll discuss memory in much more detail in Chapter 6.
Short-Term Memory
Short-term memory refers to an agent’s ability to store and manage information rele‐
vant to the current task or conversation. This type of memory is typically used to
maintain context during an interaction, enabling the agent to make coherent deci‐
sions in real time. A customer service agent that remembers a user’s previous queries
within a session can provide more accurate and context-aware responses, enhancing
user experience.
Short-term memory is often implemented using rolling context windows, which
enable the agent to maintain a sliding window of recent information while discarding
outdated data. This is particularly useful in applications like chatbots or virtual assis‐
tants, where the agent must remember recent interactions but can forget older, irrele‐
vant details.
Long-Term Memory
Long-term memory, on the other hand, enables agents to store knowledge and expe‐
riences over extended periods, enabling them to draw on past information to inform
future actions. This is particularly important for agents that need to improve over
time or provide personalized experiences based on user preferences.
Long-term memory is often implemented using databases, knowledge graphs, or
fine-tuned models. These structures enable agents to store structured data (e.g., user
preferences, historical performance metrics) and retrieve it when needed. A health‐
care monitoring agent might retain long-term data on a patient’s vital signs, enabling
it to detect trends or provide historical insights to healthcare providers.
Memory Management and Retrieval
Effective memory management involves organizing and indexing stored data so that
it can be easily retrieved when needed. Agents that rely on memory must be able to
differentiate between relevant and irrelevant data and retrieve information quickly to
ensure seamless performance. In some cases, agents may also need to forget certain
information to avoid cluttering their memory with outdated or unnecessary details.
An ecommerce recommendation agent must store user preferences and past purchase
history to provide personalized recommendations. However, it must also prioritize
recent data to ensure that recommendations remain relevant and accurate as user
preferences change over time.
