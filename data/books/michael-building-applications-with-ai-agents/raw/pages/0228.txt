processes, developers can guide the design and implementation of agent systems
toward achieving high performance and user satisfaction.
Measurement Is the Keystone
Effective measurement begins with identifying clear, actionable metrics that align
with the goals and requirements of the agent system. These metrics serve as the
benchmarks for evaluating the agent’s ability to perform tasks and meet user expecta‐
tions. Success depends on defining specific, measurable objectives that reflect the
desired outcomes for the system, such as enhancing user engagement or automating a
complex process. By framing hero scenarios—representative examples of high-
priority use cases—developers can ensure their metrics target the core functions that
define the agent’s success. In the absence of rigorous and ongoing measurement, it
becomes impossible to know whether changes are truly improvements, to understand
how agents perform in realistic and adversarial settings, or to guard against unexpec‐
ted regressions.
Selecting the right metrics is equally crucial. Metrics should encompass a combina‐
tion of quantitative indicators, such as accuracy, response time, robustness, scalability,
precision, and recall, as well as qualitative measures like user satisfaction. For exam‐
ple, in a customer service agent, response time and accuracy might measure perfor‐
mance, while user feedback captures overall satisfaction. These metrics must reflect
the real-world demands the system will face.
In the case of language-based agents, traditional exact-match metrics frequently fail
to capture genuine utility, as correct answers can take many forms. As a result,
modern practice relies increasingly on semantic similarity measures—such as
embedding-based distance, BERTScore, BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), or
ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)—to evaluate whether
agent outputs truly meet the intent of a given task, even if the wording diverges from
a reference answer.
To realize the benefits of measurement, it is crucial to integrate evaluation mecha‐
nisms directly into the agent-development lifecycle. Rather than relegating evaluation
to the end, successful teams automate as much as possible, triggering tests whenever
new code is merged or models are updated. By maintaining a consistent source of
truth for key metrics over time, it becomes possible to detect regressions early, pre‐
venting new bugs or degradations from reaching production. Automated evaluation,
however, rarely tells the whole story. Particularly in novel or high-stakes domains,
regular sampling and human-in-the-loop review of agent outputs can uncover subtle
issues and provide a qualitative sense of progress or remaining challenges. The most
effective teams treat evaluation as an iterative process, refining both their agents and
their metrics in response to ongoing feedback and changing requirements.
