Aggregating and Prioritizing Improvements
As agentic systems grow in complexity and scale, so does the stream of actionable
insights generated by feedback pipelines and human review. Teams quickly discover
that not every bug, misfire, or enhancement can—or should—be addressed immedi‐
ately. Without a system for aggregating and prioritizing improvements, teams risk
being overwhelmed by noise, chasing low-impact fixes, or missing systemic problems
in favor of surface-level symptoms.
The first step is aggregation: consolidating insights from multiple sources into a uni‐
fied, accessible view. Feedback may originate from automated monitoring systems,
RCA reports, user complaints, HITL reviews, or direct engineer observation. Aggre‐
gation platforms (such as centralized dashboards, observability tools, or structured
issue trackers) help transform scattered data into a coherent improvement backlog.
Key practices include:
Deduplication
Clustering similar issues together (e.g., recurring prompt failures or repeated tool
invocation errors) to avoid fragmented effort
Tagging and categorization
Labeling issues by root cause, affected workflows, user impact, or system compo‐
nent for easier sorting and filtering
Linking to context
Attaching supporting logs, traces, user reports, and RCA documentation to each
improvement for efficient triage and action
With a unified backlog in hand, the next challenge is prioritization. Not all improve‐
ments are created equal—some have outsized impact on system reliability, user satis‐
faction, or business outcomes. Effective prioritization requires balancing several
dimensions:
Frequency
How often does this issue occur? Frequent but minor issues can add up to signifi‐
cant user friction or operational overhead.
Severity/Impact
What is the business or user impact? Issues causing critical failures, security risks,
or major dissatisfaction should rise to the top.
Feasibility
How difficult is the fix? Quick wins (low effort, high impact) are often priori‐
tized, while complex improvements may require careful scoping or sequencing.
