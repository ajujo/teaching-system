Masked language model (MLM)
A pretraining technique where words in a
sentence are randomly masked and
predicted.
Memory-augmented AI
AI systems that maintain persistent
knowledge beyond a single session.
Meta-Agent Search (MAS)
An automated process that explores, com‐
bines, and evaluates different agent archi‐
tectures, components, and configurations
to 
discover 
high-performing 
agentic
systems.
Meta-prompting
Using structured prompts to guide an AI
system’s behavior.
Named entity recognition (NER)
A technique for identifying entities like
names, dates, and locations in text.
Natural language processing (NLP)
The field of AI focused on understanding
and generating human language.
Neural network (NN)
A computational model inspired by the
human brain, used in deep learning.
Optimization
The process of improving a model’s accu‐
racy and efficiency.
Overfitting
When a model learns patterns that are too
specific to the training data and fails to
generalize.
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
Techniques that adapt large models with
minimal changes.
Perplexity
A measure of a language model’s uncer‐
tainty in predicting text.
Prompt engineering
The process of crafting inputs to maxi‐
mize AI performance.
Quantization
Reducing a model’s precision to speed up
inference.
Query expansion
Improving search results by adding
related terms to a user’s query.
Recurrent neural network (RNN)
A type of neural network that processes
sequential data.
Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
A training technique where human pref‐
erences guide model behavior.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
A method where external knowledge is
retrieved 
to 
enhance 
AI-generated
responses.
Scaling laws
Principles governing how model perfor‐
mance improves with increased size and
data.
Self-attention
A mechanism in transformers that deter‐
mines the importance of different input
tokens.
Semantic search
A search technique that retrieves relevant
information based on meaning rather
than exact words.
Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
A model architecture used for translation
and summarization tasks.
Softmax
A function that converts logits into proba‐
bility distributions.
Temperature
A hyperparameter that controls random‐
ness in AI-generated outputs.
Tokenization
The process of splitting text into units
(tokens) for model input.
