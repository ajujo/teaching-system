coordination between IT, data governance teams, and agent developers to ensure that
agents never exceed their intended scope.
These varying scopes also demand differentiated policies. Organizations should not
apply a one-size-fits-all approach to autonomy, escalation, or logging. For instance, a
personal agent might be permitted to send emails or schedule meetings autono‐
mously, whereas a functional agent in finance may be required to route every action
through a human-in-the-loop approval.
Organizational agents—those operating with the widest access—may require multiple
layers of authorization or an internal governance board to review and approve behav‐
iors and system updates. As agent scope increases from personal to organizational,
both the autonomy level and associated risk rise. As is shown in Table 13-3, this pro‐
gression demands increasingly robust governance—moving from lightweight user
controls to enterprise-wide compliance, auditing, and oversight mechanisms.

Ultimately, defining agent scope is not just a technical architecture decision—it is a
governance one. As agents become more essential to organizational workflows, their
scope determines not only what they can do, but what they should do, and under
whose watch. In the next section, we turn to the closely related question of how mem‐
ory and context should be managed across these different scopes, and the trust, pri‐
vacy, and continuity implications that arise when agents begin to remember not just
for individuals—but for teams, departments, and the organization as a whole.
Shared Memory and Context Boundaries
As agents expand beyond individual use to support teams and organizations, how
they manage memory becomes a critical design concern. Memory enables agents to
personalize experiences, maintain context across sessions, and improve over time—
but at larger scopes, it also introduces serious risks around privacy, misuse, and gov‐
ernance. Agents should never assume access to personal or sensitive data across
