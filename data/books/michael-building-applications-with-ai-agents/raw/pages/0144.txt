During generation, the retrieved information is then fed into a generative foundation
model, which uses this context to produce a coherent and contextually appropriate
response. The generative model synthesizes the retrieved data with its own learned
knowledge, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the generated text, as is illustra‐
ted in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-2. RAG runtime workflow. The user submits a question to the controller, which
queries the vector knowledge store to retrieve the most relevant information. This
retrieved context is then combined with the original user question and passed to the gen‐
erative model, which produces a final, contextually informed response.
RAG represents a powerful approach for enhancing the capabilities of agentic systems
by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. By leveraging external
knowledge and integrating it into the generation process, RAG enables the creation of
more informed, accurate, and contextually relevant responses. As technology contin‐
ues to evolve, RAG will play a crucial role in advancing the performance and versatil‐
ity of LLM-powered applications across various domains. This is especially valuable
for incorporating domain- or company-specific information or policies to influence
the output.
Semantic Experience Memory
While incorporating an external knowledge base with a semantic store is an effective
way to incorporate external knowledge into our agent, our agent will start every
session from a blank slate, and the context of long-running or complex tasks will
gradually drop out of the context window. Both of these issues can be addressed by
semantic experience memory.
