For example, a user might begin interacting with an agent via voice while driving,
continue the conversation on their phone through text while walking into a meeting,
and later review a graphical dashboard summarizing results on their laptop. In
another scenario, a voice assistant might read out a summary of an analytics report
before emailing a detailed, text-based version with accompanying charts for later ref‐
erence. This fluid transition between modalities preserves user context, respects sit‐
uational constraints, and delivers the right interaction style at each moment.
Designing for modality fluidity requires careful state management and context persis‐
tence so that information, task progress, and user preferences are never lost in transi‐
tion. Agents must also adapt their communication style to suit each modality—for
example, delivering concise spoken summaries while providing more detailed textual
outputs for review.
This is an exciting time for the field of human-computer interaction. Recent advances
in foundation models, multimodal architectures, and agent orchestration are unlock‐
ing entirely new ways of interacting with intelligent systems. For the first time, it is
technically feasible to build agents that engage users across text, voice, images, and
video in a single, unified workflow.
However, while the technology frontier is expanding rapidly, it is critical to remember
that core UX and product principles remain unchanged. Building successful agent
experiences isn’t about showcasing the latest modality integrations or generative UI
capabilities for their own sake. It is about understanding users deeply, meeting them
where they are, and creating intuitive, trustworthy, and delightful experiences that
solve real problems in their lives.
The best products are not those that merely demonstrate technological sophistica‐
tion, but those that use technology to amplify human capability in elegant and unob‐
trusive ways. As we continue to push the boundaries of modality design, let us stay
grounded in the timeless goal of great product design: creating tools that people love
to use, that make their lives easier, and that empower them to achieve what matters
most.
The Autonomy Slider
A critical yet often overlooked dimension in UX design is the level of autonomy gran‐
ted to agents. As Andrej Karpathy described, effective agentic systems should allow
users to smoothly adjust an agent’s autonomy—from fully manual control to partial
automation to fully autonomous operation. This concept, often called an autonomy
slider, empowers users to choose how much control they wish to retain versus dele‐
gate at any given time. Figure 3-4 illustrates a simple example of an autonomy slider
interface, enabling users to set the agent to “Manual,” “Ask,” or “Agent” mode depend‐
ing on their task, trust, and context.
