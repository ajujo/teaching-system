Another key UX consideration is how the context is managed over time. Some gener‐
ative AI applications have no memory or learning, so have precisely the information
you present them with in exactly that session. This requires users to copy and paste
information into the prompt. More modern applications automatically manage this
context for you. For example, Cursor uses the integrated development environment
to intelligently identify code to include in each model inference. Some applications
retain memory over time, enabling agents to remember past interactions, maintain
conversation flow, and adapt to user preferences over time. Without these capabili‐
ties, even technically advanced agents risk feeling disjointed or unresponsive. Simi‐
larly, communicating agent capabilities, limitations, and uncertainty is essential for
setting realistic user expectations and preventing misunderstandings. Users must
know what an agent can and cannot do, and when they might need to intervene or 
provide guidance.
Finally, trust and transparency remain foundational to positive user experiences with
agent systems. Predictable agent behavior and clear explanations of actions contrib‐
ute to building relationships where users feel confident relying on agents in high-
stakes scenarios.
This chapter explores these core aspects of UX design for agentic systems, offering
principles, best practices, and actionable insights to help you design interactions that
are intuitive, reliable, and aligned with user needs. Whether you’re building a chatbot,
an AI-powered personal assistant, or a fully autonomous workflow agent, the princi‐
ples in this chapter will help you create meaningful and effective experiences that
users can trust.
Interaction Modalities
Agent systems interact with users through a variety of modalities, each offering
unique strengths, limitations, and design considerations. Whether through text,
graphical interfaces, speech, or video, the choice of modality shapes how users per‐
ceive and interact with agents. Text-based interfaces excel in clarity and traceability;
graphical interfaces offer visual richness and intuitive controls; voice interactions
provide hands-free convenience; and video interfaces enable dynamic, real-time
communication.
In the next section, we’ll explore these interaction modalities, examining their key
strengths, challenges, and best practices for delivering exceptional UX in agent
systems.
