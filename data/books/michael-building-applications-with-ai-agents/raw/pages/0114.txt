ReflAct framework—the agent continuously grounds its reasoning in goal-state
reflections, measuring its current state against the intended outcome and adjusting its
plan when misalignments arise. Reflection prompts encourage the model to critique
its own chain of thought, correct logical errors, and reinforce successful strategies,
effectively simulating human-style self-assessment during complex problem-solving.
This pattern shines in high-stakes workflows where early errors can cascade into
costly failures—such as financial transaction orchestration, medical diagnosis sup‐
port, or critical incident response. By pairing each action with a reflection step, agents
detect when tool outputs deviate from expectations and can replan or roll back before
committing to irreversible operations. The added metareasoning overhead does incur
extra latency and compute, but for tasks where correctness and reliability outweigh
speed, reflection agents offer a powerful guardrail against error propagation and help
maintain alignment with overarching goals.
Deep Research Agents
Deep research agents specialize in tackling open-ended, highly complex investiga‐
tions that require extensive external knowledge gathering, hypothesis testing, and
synthesis—think literature reviews, scientific discovery, or strategic market analysis.
They combine multiple patterns: a planner-executor phase to chart research work‐
flows; query-decomposition to break down big questions into targeted searches; and
ReAct loops to iteratively refine hypotheses based on new findings. In a typical cycle,
a deep research agent will:
1. Plan the overall research agenda (e.g., identify key subtopics or data sources).
2. Decompose each subtopic into concrete queries (via SELF_ASK or similar).
3. Invoke tools—from academic search APIs to domain-specific databases—and
reflect on the relevance and reliability of each result.
4. Synthesize the insights into an evolving report or set of recommendations, using
LLM-driven summarization and critique at each step.
Strengths
Capability
It can handle high-complexity, multistage investigations that lean on specialized
databases and cross-disciplinary sources.
Adaptive
Research direction is adjusted as new evidence emerges.
Transparent
Explicit plans and decomposition steps make it easier to audit methodology.
