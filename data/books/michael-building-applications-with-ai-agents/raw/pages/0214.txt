While A2A presents an exciting direction for multiagent systems—offering a modu‐
lar, runtime-agnostic approach to delegation and coordination—it is still in its
infancy. Significant open questions remain, particularly around security. Authentica‐
tion is currently supported via pluggable mechanisms, but robust authorization, rate-
limiting, trust establishment, and abuse resistance are far from solved. As with any
early protocol, it should be approached with both enthusiasm and caution. Early
adopters should expect vulnerabilities, implementation gaps, and evolving
specifications.
Still, A2A points to a future where agents don’t operate in isolation but as part of
dynamic, loosely coupled ecosystems capable of tackling broader and more sophisti‐
cated problems. Much like HTTP enabled the composability of the web, A2A aspires
to do the same for AI agents. It’s too early to say whether it will become the
standard—but it’s a promising beginning in the quest to make agent cooperation
seamless, scalable, and secure.
Message Brokers and Event Buses
As agent-based systems scale, point-to-point communication becomes brittle and
inflexible. A common alternative is to adopt message brokers or event buses, which
