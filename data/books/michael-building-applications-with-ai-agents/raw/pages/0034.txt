performance relevance as tasks evolve. Example: agents that ignore feedback
loops may keep making the same mistakes—like misclassifying contract clauses
or failing to escalate critical support issues.
Resilience
Develop robust resilience architectures capable of gracefully handling errors,
security threats, timeouts, and unexpected conditions. Incorporate comprehen‐
sive error handling, stringent security measures, and redundancy to ensure relia‐
ble and continuous agent operations. Example: agents without retry or fallback
logic may crash entirely when a single API call fails, leaving the user waiting and
confused.
Future-proofing
Build agent systems around open standards and scalable infrastructure, fostering
a culture of innovation to adapt quickly to emerging technologies and evolving
user expectations. Example: tightly coupling your agent to one proprietary ven‐
dor’s prompt format can make switching models painful and limit
experimentation.
Adhering to these principles enables organizations to develop autonomous agents
that remain effective and relevant, adapting seamlessly to technological advance‐
ments and changing operational environments.
Organizing for Success in Building Agentic Systems
The widespread availability of foundation models via simple API calls has spurred
extensive experimentation with agent systems across many organizations. Teams fre‐
quently embark on independent proofs of concept, leading to valuable discoveries
and innovative ideas. However, this ease of experimentation often results in fragmen‐
tation—overlapping projects, duplicated efforts, and unfinished experiments become
scattered throughout the organization. Conversely, premature standardization could
stifle creativity and trap organizations into rigid frameworks or vendor-specific solu‐
tions. Achieving success requires balancing flexibility for experimentation with suffi‐
cient alignment for scalability and coherence.
In the early phases of agent development, organizations should actively encourage
exploratory efforts, permitting teams to test various architectures, workflows, and
models freely. Over time, as successful patterns and best practices become apparent,
strategic alignment becomes critical. Implementing a “one standard per large group”
strategy can effectively balance this need. Within specific departments or functional
areas, teams can standardize around common tools and methodologies, streamlining
collaboration without restricting broader organizational innovation.
Another essential aspect of success is avoiding vendor lock-in by adopting open
standards, such as OpenAPI, and embracing modular system designs. These practices
