CHAPTER 13
Human-Agent Collaboration
As agentic systems weave into our workflows, success depends as much on how they
collaborate with humans on raw capabilities. This chapter brings together the
interaction-level mechanics (interfaces, uncertainty signals, handoffs) and the gover‐
nance structures (oversight, compliance, trust calibration) that turn opaque assistants
into dependable teammates.
Effective collaboration depends on calibrating autonomy: knowing when an agent
should act on its own, when it should ask a question, and when it should defer
entirely to a person. We’ll walk through strategies for progressive delegation—starting
with simple drafts or suggestions and building toward greater independence as trust
grows—and we’ll highlight how to repair that trust if mistakes happen.
Roles and Autonomy
This section explains how agentic systems shift from human-guided execution to
autonomous operation—and how human roles evolve to match. As agent systems
gain autonomy, one of the most important questions becomes: what role should the
human play? The answer is not static. It shifts based on the task, the stakes, and—
most critically—the level of trust between human and agent. This section explores
how those roles evolve over time, how organizations can design for progressive dele‐
gation, and what it takes to align people, processes, and expectations as agents
become more capable collaborators. We begin by tracing the arc from executor to
governor, then examine the organizational dynamics that shape adoption and
engagement.
