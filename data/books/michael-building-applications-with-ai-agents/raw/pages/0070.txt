Similarly, Figure 3-3 shows a modern AI-enabled IDE interface, similar to tools like
Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and many more. These environments integrate natural lan‐
guage understanding directly into the coding workflow, enabling developers to ask
questions, generate code, refactor functions, and receive explanations or performance
optimizations—all within a single, streamlined graphical interface.

enhanced with AI capabilities, combining traditional file explorers and code editors with
natural language assistant panels that provide explanations, debugging suggestions, and
autogenerated code improvements.
Together, these examples illustrate the rapid evolution of graphical agentic UX. As
these interfaces mature, they will redefine what productive, AI-enabled tools look like
—not just for developers, but for every knowledge-intensive profession.
A growing frontier in graphical agent interfaces is the emergence of generative UIs.
Instead of relying solely on static dashboards or predesigned layouts, generative UIs
dynamically create interface elements, data visualizations, or structured outputs based
on user queries. For example, Perplexity AI not only provides textual answers but also
generates structured knowledge cards, reference lists, and data tables tailored to the
question asked. Similarly, AI coding copilots generate entire forms, config files, or UI
components based on user intent.
