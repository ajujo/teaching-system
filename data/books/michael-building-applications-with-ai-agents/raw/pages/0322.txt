The first step is to involve stakeholders early in the design process—not just as test‐
ers, but as co-creators. This includes defining clear goals: what specific outcomes
should the agent improve? What decisions should it take on, and which should
remain human-led? What would success—and failure—look like?
Crucially, success metrics must go beyond technical performance. An agent that com‐
pletes tasks quickly but undermines trust or adds friction will not be adopted. Stake‐
holder buy-in depends on perceived usefulness, reliability, and alignment with
existing workflows and values.
Implementing agentic systems is also an opportunity for broader organizational
learning. When expectations diverge—between users and developers, or between
what the agent can do and what stakeholders believe it should do—those moments
can be used to clarify priorities, refine requirements, and recalibrate roles. Friction, if
handled transparently, becomes fuel for iteration.
To support ongoing adoption, organizations should invest in training, feedback
loops, and responsive support. Just as agents evolve, so should their onboarding
materials and integration guides. Teams need spaces to voice concerns, propose
improvements, and celebrate small wins as the agent grows into its role.
For example, ZoomInfo’s four-phase rollout of GitHub Copilot began with a small
pilot of 50 engineers and only expanded to its full team of more than 400+ people
once metrics (a 33% suggestion acceptance rate and 72% developer satisfaction) met
carefully established thresholds—and qualitative feedback confirmed that Copilot
suggestions were genuinely helpful. By tying each expansion to concrete trust signals,
ZoomInfo transformed Copilot from a nice-to-have into a core productivity tool.
Ultimately, adoption is not a binary switch—it’s a journey of coevolution between
humans and their agent teammates. Systems that succeed are those where stakehold‐
ers don’t just use the agent—they believe in its value and see it as an extension of their
goals.
Bridging this gap is not optional. It’s the difference between agentic systems that qui‐
etly fade and those that truly transform how work gets done. With human roles
defined and adoption strategies in place, we now turn to how collaboration itself
scales—moving from individual assistants to team-wide and enterprise-level agents.
Scaling Collaboration
In this section, we examine how agents expand from individual assistants to team and
enterprise collaborators—and what each stage demands of human and system design.
As organizations adopt agents more broadly, their roles evolve from isolated assis‐
tants to collaborative participants embedded across teams, departments, and strategic
workflows. Understanding how agent responsibilities scale—from personal tools to
