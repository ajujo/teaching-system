Context engineering sits at the intersection of memory, knowledge, and orchestra‐
tion. While orchestration decides what steps to take in a workflow, context engineer‐
ing ensures that each step has the right information to execute effectively. As
foundation models continue to improve, the frontier of agentic system design is shift‐
ing from model architecture to the quality of context we provide. In essence, a well-
engineered context unlocks the full potential of even modest models, while poor
context can undermine the performance of the most advanced systems.
By mastering context engineering, developers can create agents that are not only
technically powerful but also reliable, grounded, and responsive to the needs of their
users and environments. In the coming years, as memory systems, retrieval architec‐
tures, and orchestration frameworks evolve, context engineering will remain the glue
that binds these components into seamless, effective experiences.
Conclusion
The success of agents relies heavily on the approach to orchestration, making it
important for organizations interested in building agentic systems to invest time and
energy into designing the appropriate planning strategy for the use case. Here are
some best practices for designing a planning system:
• Carefully consider the requirements for latency and accuracy for your system, as
there is a clear trade-off between these two factors.
• Determine the typical number of actions required for your scenario’s use case.
The greater this number, the more complex an approach to planning you are
likely to need.
• Assess how much the plan needs to change based on the results from prior
actions. If significant adaptation is necessary, consider a technique that allows for
incremental plan adjustments.
• Design a representative set of test cases to evaluate different planning approaches
and identify the best fit for your use case.
• Choose the simplest planning approach that will meet your use case
requirements.
With an orchestration approach that will work well for your scenario, we’ll now move
on to the next part of the workflow: memory. It is worth starting small with well-
designed scenarios and simpler approaches to orchestration, and to then gradually
move up the scale of complexity as necessary based on the use case. In the next chap‐
ter, we will explore how memory can further enhance your agents’ capabilities—ena‐
bling them to recall knowledge, maintain context across interactions, and perform
tasks with greater intelligence and personalization.
