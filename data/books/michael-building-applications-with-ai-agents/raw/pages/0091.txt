Handle errors gracefully
Provide clear, polite fallbacks when the agent can’t fulfill a request.
Build trust
Be transparent about limitations, confidence, and reasoning.
Equally important is how agents communicate their capabilities, limitations, and
uncertainties. Clear expectations, honest confidence signals, and thoughtful clarifica‐
tion questions create trust, reduce frustration, and prevent misunderstandings.
Agents must also know how to fail gracefully, guiding users toward alternative solu‐
tions without leaving them stranded or confused.
Finally, building trust through predictability, transparency, and responsible design
choices ensures that users can rely on agents. Trust is earned not just through success
but also through how agents handle ambiguity, failure, and recovery.
As the agent landscape continues to shift and expand, designers and developers must
remain agile—continually reevaluating interaction paradigms, adapting to new multi‐
modal capabilities, and experimenting with novel UX patterns. The design patterns
described here provide a robust starting point, but the future of agentic UX will be
shaped by rapid innovation in modalities, context management, and human-agent
collaboration. In the years ahead, agent systems will continue to evolve, becoming
more deeply embedded in our personal and professional lives. The principles out‐
lined in this chapter—focused on clarity, adaptability, transparency, and trust—pro‐
vide a blueprint for creating agent experiences that are not just functional, but
intuitive, engaging, and deeply aligned with human needs.
By prioritizing UX at every stage of development, we can ensure that agents become
not just tools, but indispensable partners in our increasingly intelligent digital ecosys‐
tems. In Chapter 4, we’ll cover tool use, which is how we move from ordinary chat‐
bots to systems that can do real work for users.
