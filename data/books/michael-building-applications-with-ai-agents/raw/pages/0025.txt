enables these models to interact directly with external systems and execute practical
tasks. These models are capable of:
Contextual interpretation and decision making
Navigating ambiguous situations without exhaustive preprogramming
Tool use
Calling other software to retrieve information or take actions
Adaptive planning
Planning and executing complex, multistep actions autonomously
Information summarization
Rapidly processing extensive documents, extracting key insights, thereby aiding
legal analysis, research synthesis, and content curation
Management of unstructured data
Interpreting and responding intelligently to unstructured texts such as emails,
documents, logs, and reports
Code generation
Writing and executing code and writing unit tests
Routine task automation
Efficiently handling repetitive activities in customer service and administrative
workflows, freeing human workers to focus on more nuanced tasks
Multimodal information synthesis
Performing intricate analyses of image, audio, or video data at scale
This enhanced flexibility enables autonomous agents to effectively handle complex
and dynamic scenarios that static ML models typically cannot address.
Types of Agents
As the term “agent” has gained popularity, its meaning has broadened to encompass a
wide range of AI-enabled systems, often creating confusion about what truly consti‐
tutes an AI agent. The Information categorizes agents into seven practical types,
reflecting how these technologies are being applied today:
Business-task agents
These agents automate predefined business workflows, such as UiPath’s robotic
process automation, Microsoft Power Automate’s low-code flows, or Zapier’s app
integrations. They execute sequences of deterministic actions, typically triggered
by events, with minimal contextual reasoning.
