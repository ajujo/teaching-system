most likely actions based on current user inputs, historical behavior, or workflow
stage ensures the agent feels supportive rather than cluttered. Visual grouping and
clear hierarchy within menus or suggested actions help users navigate available
options efficiently.
These principles apply across modalities. In text-based chat interfaces, quick-reply
buttons and example prompts improve clarity. In graphical dashboards, capability
menus and tooltips communicate functions without crowding the interface. Voice
agents must balance brevity with clarity, listing only a few high-priority options at a
time to avoid cognitive overload. Generative UI systems can combine natural lan‐
guage and dynamically generated visual outputs to make available capabilities imme‐
diately visible and actionable.
Ultimately, communicating agent capabilities is not merely about stating what the
agent can do; it is about designing an experience that empowers users to harness
those capabilities confidently and efficiently. When users understand an agent’s scope
and limitations, they are far more likely to engage productively, trust its outputs, and
integrate it into their workflows. Thoughtful UX design turns invisible functions into
visible affordances, transforming agents from opaque black boxes into transparent,
collaborative digital partners.
Communicating Confidence and Uncertainty
Agents often operate in probabilistic environments, generating outputs based on stat‐
istical models rather than deterministic rules. As a result, not every response or
action carries the same degree of confidence. Communicating uncertainty effectively
is essential for building user trust and helping users make informed decisions.
Confidence levels can be expressed in several ways:
Explicit statements
“I’m 90% certain this is the correct answer.”
Visual cues
Icons, color-coded alerts, or confidence meters in graphical interfaces.
Behavioral adjustments
Offering suggestions rather than firm recommendations when confidence is low.
Agents must avoid appearing overly confident when uncertainty is high—users are
quick to lose trust if an agent confidently delivers an incorrect or misleading
response. Similarly, excessive hedging in low-stakes interactions can make an agent
appear hesitant or unreliable.
Communicating confidence and uncertainty isn’t just about sharing probabilities; it’s
about framing responses in a way that aligns with user expectations and the stakes of
