Communication Techniques
As agentic systems grow from single-agent prototypes into multiagent, distributed
systems, the choice of communication architecture becomes increasingly critical.
What starts as simple in-memory message passing or function calls quickly becomes
untenable as systems grow in scope, number of agents, geographic distribution, or
deployment complexity. This section explores the core techniques and technologies
available for managing communication, coordination, and task flow across agents—
especially as systems transition from single-device experiments to production-grade
distributed deployments. The reader will notice there are many valid approaches, all
with different trade-offs in development effort, latency, scalability, reliability, and
cost.
Local Versus Distributed Communication
At a small scale—such as a single-device or single-process setup—agents often com‐
municate through direct function calls, shared memory, or in-memory message
queues. While simple and efficient, these methods don’t scale well. As soon as agents
are distributed across services, containers, or nodes, communication must be made
explicit, asynchronous, and fault-tolerant.
In local deployments, frameworks like AutoGen often use in-memory routers to
orchestrate agent message passing and tool invocation. These setups can work well
for research and prototyping, especially with single-threaded or single-agent configu‐
rations. But for production use, communication and state management must evolve.
Agent-to-Agent Protocol
The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol, introduced by Google, is an ambitious and
promising step toward enabling autonomous agents to work together toward more
complex goals. It offers a standardized, cross-platform mechanism for agents to dis‐
cover each other, negotiate collaboration, and exchange structured requests—without
revealing internal logic or implementation details. By enabling heterogeneous agents
to interoperate over HTTP-based transports, A2A creates a shared language that
could, in time, make multiagent coordination as routine as API calls between
microservices.
At the core of A2A is the Agent Card, a machine-readable JSON descriptor that each
agent publishes to advertise its identity, capabilities, endpoints, and supported
authentication methods. These cards enable agents to find peers, evaluate their func‐
tions, and negotiate secure communication channels. Capabilities are defined explic‐
itly—such as generateReport, summarizeLegalDocument—along with schemas for
inputs and outputs, enabling structured composition of agent workflows. Endpoint
information and supported authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2, API key) ensure
