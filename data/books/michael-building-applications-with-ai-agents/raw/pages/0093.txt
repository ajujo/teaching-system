CHAPTER 4
Tool Use
While foundation models are great at chatting for hours, tools are the building blocks
that empower AI agents to retrieve additional information and context, perform
tasks, and interact with the environment in meaningful ways. In the context of AI, a
tool can be defined as a specific capability or a set of actions that an agent can per‐
form to achieve a desired outcome. These tools range from simple, single-step tasks
to complex, multistep operations that require advanced reasoning and problem-
solving abilities. Especially if you want your agent to make actual changes, instead of
just searching for and providing information, tools will be how those changes are
executed.
The significance of tools in AI agents parallels the importance of competencies in
human professionals. Just as a doctor needs a diverse set of tools to diagnose and treat
patients, an AI agent requires a repertoire of tools to handle various tasks effectively.
This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of tools in AI agents,
exploring their design, development, and deployment.
AI agents, at their core, are sophisticated systems designed to interact with their envi‐
ronment, process information, and execute tasks autonomously. To do this efficiently,
they rely on a structured set of tools. These tools are modular components that can be
developed, tested, and optimized independently, then integrated to form a cohesive
system capable of complex behavior.
In practical terms, a tool could be as simple as recognizing an object in an image or as
complex as managing a customer support ticket from initial contact to resolution.
The design and implementation of these tools are critical to the overall functionality
and effectiveness of the AI agent. We’ll start with some fundamentals of LangChain,
and then cover the different types of tools that can be provided to an autonomous
agent, which we will cover in sequence: local tools, API-based tools, and MCP tools.
