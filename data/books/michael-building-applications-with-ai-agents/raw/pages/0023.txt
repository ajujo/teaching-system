CHAPTER 1
Introduction to Agents
We are witnessing a profound technological transformation driven by autonomous
agents—intelligent software systems capable of independent reasoning, decision mak‐
ing, and interacting effectively within dynamic environments. Unlike traditional soft‐
ware, autonomous agents interpret contexts, adapt to changing scenarios, and
perform sophisticated actions with minimal human oversight.
Defining AI Agents
Autonomous agents are intelligent systems designed to independently analyze data,
interpret their environment, and make context-driven decisions. As the popularity of
the term “agent” grows, its meaning has become diluted, often applied to systems
lacking genuine autonomy. In practice, agency exists on a spectrum. True autono‐
mous agents demonstrate meaningful decision making, context-driven reasoning,
and adaptive behaviors. Conversely, many systems labeled as “agents” may simply
execute deterministic scripts or tightly controlled workflows. Designing genuinely
autonomous, adaptive agents is challenging, prompting many teams to adopt simpler
approaches to achieve quicker outcomes. Therefore, the key test of a true agent is
whether it demonstrates real decision making rather than following static scripts.
The rapid evolution of autonomous agents is primarily driven by breakthroughs in
foundation models and reinforcement learning. While traditional use cases with
foundation models have focused on generating human-readable outputs, the latest
advances enable these models to generate structured function signatures and parame‐
ter selections. Orchestration frameworks can then execute these functions—enabling
agents to look up data, manipulate external systems, and perform concrete actions.
Throughout this book, we will use the term “agentic system” to describe the full sup‐
porting functionality that enables an agent to run effectively, including the tools,
memory, foundation model, orchestration, and supporting infrastructure.
