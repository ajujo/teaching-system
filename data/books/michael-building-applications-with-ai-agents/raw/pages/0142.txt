Vector stores—such as VectorDB, FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), or Annoy
(Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)—are optimized for storing and searching
high-dimensional vectors. These stores are set up for fast similarity searches, enabling
the retrieval of embeddings that are semantically similar to a given query.
When an agent receives a query or needs to retrieve information, it can use the vector
store to perform similarity searches based on the query’s embedding. By finding and
retrieving the most relevant embeddings from the vector store, the agent can access
the stored semantic memory and provide informed, contextually appropriate respon‐
ses. These lookups can be performed quickly, providing an efficient way to rapidly
search over large volumes of information to improve the quality of actions and
responses. This can be implemented as follows:
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5")
def call_model(state: MessagesState):
   response = llm.invoke(state["messages"])
   return {"messages": response}

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical 
model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the 
idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make 
decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms 
are trained on datasets that contain examples of the desired output. 
For example, a machine learning algorithm that is used to classify 
images might be trained on a dataset that contains images of cats 
and dogs. Once an algorithm is trained, it can be used to make 
predictions on new data. For example, the machine learning algorithm 
that is used to classify images could be used to predict whether a new 
image contains a cat or a dog.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines
that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with
a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for 
solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis.
