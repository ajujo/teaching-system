Designing effective text-based agents therefore requires strategies to enhance discov‐
erability. Agents should proactively communicate their supported functions, either
through onboarding messages, periodic capability reminders, or dynamic suggestions
during conversation. For instance, an agent can respond to a greeting not only with
“How can I help you today?” but also with “I can help you cancel orders, check deliv‐
ery status, or update your account details.” This approach ensures users understand
the agent’s operational boundaries, reducing trial-and-error interactions.
Beyond discoverability, text-based design requires careful attention to clarity, context
retention, and error management. Agents should communicate with concise and
unambiguous responses, avoiding overly technical jargon or long-winded explana‐
tions that may overwhelm the user. Maintaining context across multiturn conversa‐
tions is equally important; users should not need to repeat themselves or clarify past
instructions. Effective agents are also graceful in failure, providing clear error mes‐
sages and fallback mechanisms, such as escalating to a human operator or offering
alternative suggestions when they cannot fulfill a request. Turn-taking management is
another subtle but crucial element—agents must guide conversations naturally, bal‐
ancing when to ask follow-up questions and when to pause for user input.
Ambiguity in natural language remains a significant hurdle, as users may phrase
requests in unexpected ways, requiring robust intent recognition to avoid misunder‐
standings. Additionally, text-based agents are often constrained by response length
limits—too short, and they risk being cryptic; too long, and they risk overwhelming
or frustrating the user. Emotional nuance is another limitation. Without vocal tone,
facial expressions, or visual cues, text-based agents must rely on carefully crafted lan‐
guage to ensure they convey empathy, friendliness, or urgency where appropriate.
Despite these challenges, text-based agents shine in scenarios where precision, tracea‐
bility, and asynchronous communication are valuable. They excel in customer sup‐
port, where chatbots provide quick answers to frequently asked questions, or in
productivity tools, where command-line interfaces help users execute tasks efficiently.
They are equally effective in knowledge retrieval systems, answering specific ques‐
tions or pulling data from structured databases.
