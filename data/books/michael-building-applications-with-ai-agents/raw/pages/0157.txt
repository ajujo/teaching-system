CHAPTER 7
Learning in Agentic Systems
This chapter covers different techniques for approaching and integrating learning
into agentic systems. Adding the capability for agents to learn and improve over time
is an incredibly useful addition, but is not necessary when designing agents. Imple‐
menting learning capabilities takes additional design, evaluation, and monitoring,
which may or may not be worth the investment depending on the application. By 
learning, we mean improving the performance of the agentic system through interac‐
tion with the environment. This process enables agents to adapt to changing condi‐
tions, refine their strategies, and enhance their overall effectiveness.
Nonparametric learning refers to techniques to change and improve performance
automatically without changing the parameters of the models involved. In contrast,
parametric learning refers to techniques in which we specifically train or fine-tune
the parameters of the foundation model. We will start by exploring nonparametric
learning techniques, then cover parametric fine-tuning approaches, including super‐
vised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, that adapt model weights for
targeted improvements.
Nonparametric Learning
Multiple techniques exist to do this, and we will explore several of the most common
and useful approaches.
Nonparametric Exemplar Learning
The simplest of these techniques is exemplar learning. In this approach, as the agent
performs its task, it is provided with a measure of quality, and those examples are
used to improve future performance. These examples are used as few-shot examples
