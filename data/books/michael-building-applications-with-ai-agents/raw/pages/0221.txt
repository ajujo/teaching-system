The manager uses a dict to track actors by session_id and agent_name, creating
them lazily. This enables scalability: Ray distributes actors across cluster nodes, and
querying state (e.g., ray.get(manager.get_session_state.remote(session_id,
agent_name))) retrieves session-specific data without global sharing.
For developers building agentic systems, actor frameworks like Orleans and Akka
offer a proven, scalable foundation for representing each agent as an autonomous,
self-contained unit—capable of handling asynchronous workflows, maintaining per‐
sistent memory, and integrating cleanly into distributed infrastructures.
Orchestration and Workflow Engines
Even with robust messaging and agent execution models, real-world systems need
orchestration—the logic that sequences tasks, handles retries, tracks dependencies,
and manages failure across agents. This is especially important for long-running or
multistep interactions that span time and components. Workflow orchestration tools
provide a higher-level abstraction, ensuring durability and recoverability in complex
agentic systems.
Workflow orchestration tools are particularly useful when processes involve unrelia‐
ble external dependencies (e.g., APIs, foundation models, or human approvals),
potential failures, or extended durations—such as supply chain workflows that may
take days due to asynchronous agent actions or real-world delays. By persisting state
and automating recovery, these engines prevent data loss and redundant work, mak‐
ing them essential for production-grade reliability where simple in-memory coordi‐
nation falls short. Use them when scaling from prototypes to resilient deployments,
especially in scenarios with high stakes like financial transactions, compliance-heavy
operations, or distributed AI agents; for quick, low-risk experiments, basic scripting
may suffice.
Temporal provides durable, stateful workflows with long-running tasks, retries, and
failure recovery. It’s ideal for managing multiagent systems where each agent may
perform asynchronous, multistep actions. Temporal workflows offer a clean abstrac‐
tion for encapsulating business logic that spans multiple services or agents over long
durations.
To illustrate Temporal’s durable execution in the supply chain multiagent system,
consider a workflow that sequences agent steps (e.g., inventory management, then
transportation arrangement, followed by supplier compliance)—with automatic
retries on failures and persistent state for recovery. Temporal ensures the workflow
resumes from the last successful step even after crashes, making it suitable for
