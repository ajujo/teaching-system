earlier inputs and the overall goal of the exchange. Testing in this area often requires
extended simulated conversations to evaluate the system's ability to sustain consistent
performance over time.
A subtle risk is that automated evaluations can miss rare but critical edge cases, espe‐
cially those arising from novel inputs or system interactions. Agents may "pass" all
standard tests but still behave unpredictably when confronted with situations outside
the test set's distribution. For this reason, ongoing manual inspection and periodic
refreshment of evaluation data are vital.
Both automated and human reviews play essential roles in addressing these chal‐
lenges. Human reviewers can assess nuanced inconsistencies and provide feedback on
how well the agent adheres to the intended purpose of its responses. This process is
particularly important for evaluating edge cases or ambiguous inputs where automa‐
ted systems may fall short. At the same time, scalable validation can be achieved
through LLM-based evaluation techniques. By using the same or related models for
consistency checking, agents can assess their own outputs against expectations. Pro‐
viding these evaluation models with few-shot examples of what constitutes a consis‐
tent and relevant response enhances their reliability.
Actor-critic approaches offer another valuable tool for consistency testing. In this
framework, the "actor" generates responses, while the "critic" evaluates them against
predefined criteria for alignment and relevance. While effective, these methods alone
may not suffice for complex or highly dynamic scenarios. The combination of actorcritic evaluations with LLM-based assessments and human feedback creates a more
comprehensive framework for identifying and addressing inconsistencies.
Consistency testing ultimately ensures that agent-based systems deliver outputs that
are aligned, logical, and purposeful, even in the face of nondeterministic behavior. By
leveraging a mix of automated validation, human oversight, and advanced evaluation
techniques like actor-critic frameworks and LLM-driven assessments, developers can
build systems that inspire trust and perform reliably in both short and long interac‐
tions. This approach addresses the unique challenges posed by LLM-based agents,
ensuring their outputs meet the high standards required for real-world applications.
Coherence
Coherence testing ensures that an agent's outputs remain logical, contextually rele‐
vant, and consistent across the span of an interaction. For agents managing multistep
workflows or sustaining extended dialogues, coherence is what enables seamless,
intuitive exchanges. The agent must retain and appropriately use context-such as
user preferences or previous actions-so that its responses build naturally on what
has come before. This is especially critical in multiturn conversations, where the
agent should reference prior information without prompting the user to repeat
themselves.
