Conclusion
Memory is critical to the successful operation of agentic systems, and while the stan‐
dard approach of relying on the context window of recent interactions is sufficient for
many use cases, more challenging scenarios can benefit substantially from the invest‐
ment into a more robust approach. We have explored several approaches here,
including semantic memory, GraphRAG, and working memory.
This chapter has delved into various aspects of how memory can be structured and
utilized to enhance the capabilities of intelligent agents. From the basic concepts of
managing context windows, through the advanced applications of semantic memory
and vector stores, to the innovative practices of dynamic knowledge graphs and
working memory, we have explored a comprehensive range of techniques and tech‐
nologies that play crucial roles in the development of agentic systems.
Memory systems in agentic applications are not just about storing data but about
transforming how agents interact with their environment and end users. By continu‐
ally improving these systems, we can create more intelligent, responsive, and capable
agents that can perform a wide range of tasks more effectively. In the next chapter, we
will explore how agents can learn from experience to improve automatically over
time.
