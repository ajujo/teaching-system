Multiagent architectures are well suited for environments where tasks are complex,
distributed, or require specialization across different components. In these systems,
multiple agents contribute to solving complex, distributed problems, such as in finan‐
cial trading systems, cybersecurity investigations, or collaborative AI research
platforms.
Single-agent systems offer simplicity and are ideal for well-defined tasks. Multiagent
systems provide collaboration, parallelism, and scalability, making them suitable for
complex environments. Choosing the right architecture depends on the complexity of
the task, the need for scalability, and the expected lifespan of the system. In the next
section, we'll discuss some principles we can follow to get the best results from the
agentic systems we build.
Best Practices
Designing agent-based systems requires more than just building agents with the right
models, skills, and architecture. To ensure that these systems perform optimally in
real-world conditions and continue to evolve as the environment changes, it's essen‐
tial to follow best practices throughout the development lifecycle. This section high‐
lights three critical best practices-iterative design, evaluation strategy, and real-world
testing-that contribute to creating adaptable, efficient, and reliable agent systems.
Iterative Design
Iterative design is a fundamental approach in agent development, emphasizing the
importance of building systems incrementally while continually incorporating feed‐
back. Instead of aiming for a perfect solution in the initial build, iterative design focu‐
ses on creating small, functional prototypes that you can evaluate, improve, and
refine over multiple cycles. This process allows for quick identification of flaws, rapid
course correction, and continuous system improvement, and it has multiple benefits:
Early detection of issues
By releasing early prototypes, developers can identify design flaws or perfor‐
mance bottlenecks before they become deeply embedded in the system. This ena‐
bles swift remediation of issues, reducing long-term development costs and
avoiding major refactors.
User-centric design
Iterative design encourages frequent feedback from stakeholders, end users, and
other developers. This feedback ensures that the agent system remains aligned
with the users' needs and expectations. As agents are tested in real-world scenar‐
ios, iterative improvements can fine-tune their behaviors and responses to better
suit the users they serve.
