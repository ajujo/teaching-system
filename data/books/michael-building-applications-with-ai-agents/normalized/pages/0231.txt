Meanwhile, standard benchmarks like MMLU, BBH, and HELM can help contextual‐
ize performance relative to broader trends in the field, even as custom benchmarks
remain essential for domain-specific agents.
Over time, a well-structured evaluation set becomes more than a test suite-it
becomes a living specification of what the agent is expected to handle. It supports
regression detection, enables continuous monitoring, and drives real progress by
ensuring that agent behavior is improving not only on average, but in the places that
matter most. This approach transforms evaluation from a static gatekeeping function
into a dynamic, model-driven feedback loop that directly shapes the trajectory of sys‐
tem development.
For novel domains, teams should invest in custom benchmark creation, often pairing
engineers with subject matter experts to define tasks, ground truth, and success crite‐
ria. This includes metadata for downstream analysis, such as failure type tagging or
coverage tracking.
Regular evaluation against this continuously evolving evaluation corpus provides a
scalable way to detect regressions, surface systemic weaknesses, and quantify
improvements with statistical rigor.
This approach transforms evaluation from a static question-answer gate into a
dynamic, model-driven feedback loop.
Component Evaluation
Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development and is critical for vali‐
dating the individual components of agent-based systems. Effective unit tests ensure
that each part of the system functions as intended, contributing to the overall reliabil‐
ity and performance of the agent.
Evaluating Tools
Tools are the core functions that empower agents to act on their environment,
retrieve or transform data, and interact with external systems. High-quality unit test‐
ing for tools begins with exhaustive enumeration of use cases, encompassing not only
the typical "happy path" but also rare, adversarial, or malformed scenarios that could
reveal brittle edges or hidden assumptions.
A mature agent development process defines a suite of automated tests for every tool.
For instance, a data retrieval tool should be tested across different data formats, var‐
ied network conditions, and with both valid and intentionally corrupted data sources.
Testing should explicitly validate not just the correctness of outputs but also latency,
resource consumption, and error handling-ensuring that the tool degrades grace‐
fully under load or failure.
