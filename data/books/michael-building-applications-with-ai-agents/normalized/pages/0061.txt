Conclusion
You don't need a 30-page plan to start building a good agent system-but a little fore‐
sight goes a long way. As we saw with our ecommerce support agent, picking a tracta‐
ble slice-like canceling orders-lets you build something small, testable, and
immediately useful. Define what success looks like, avoid vague or over-scoped ambi‐
tions, and focus on delivering clear value quickly.
Effective agent systems are more than a sum of their parts. They depend on strong
architecture, disciplined engineering, and tight feedback loops. Choosing the right
structural pattern sets the stage for scalability and resilience, while iterative develop‐
ment and robust evaluation ensure your agents improve over time. Best practices like
phased rollouts and real-world testing turn promising prototypes-like our simple
cancel order agent-into reliable systems that can be trusted in production.
In Chapter 3, we shift focus to the human side of the equation-how to design agent
experiences that are clear, responsive, and intuitive for the people who rely on them.
Ultimately, no matter how powerful your system architecture, its success depends on
how it lands in human hands.
