Best practices for using MAESTRO include integrating it iteratively into the software
development lifecycle and updating models based on emerging threats like those in
OWASP's 2025 LLM Top 10. Start with a high-level system diagram, assess each lay‐
er's assets and entry points, prioritize risks using a scoring system (e.g., Common
Vulnerability Scoring System [CVSS] for AI), and simulate attacks via red teaming (as
in the previous section). In practice, tools like Microsoft's Threat Modeling Tool can
be adapted for MAESTRO, ensuring agentic systems remain secure amid 2025's rising
AI threats, where 97% of enterprises report incidents averaging $4.4 million. By
adopting MAESTRO, organizations can transform reactive defenses into a proactive,
layered strategy, directly supporting the safeguards discussed in "Securing Agents" on
page 288.
Protecting Data in Agentic Systems
Data serves as both the fuel and the foundation of agent systems, driving decision
making, enabling contextual reasoning, and ensuring meaningful interactions with
users. However, the reliance on large datasets, continuous data exchange, and com‐
plex multiagent workflows introduces significant risks to data privacy, integrity, and
security. Agents often handle sensitive information, including personal data, propri‐
etary business insights, or confidential records, making them attractive targets for
malicious actors and prone to accidental data leaks. Protecting data in agentic sys‐
tems is not merely a technical challenge-it's a fundamental requirement for building
trust, ensuring compliance with regulations, and maintaining operational integrity.
In this section, we will explore key strategies for securing data across the agent lifecy‐
cle, beginning with data privacy and encryption, followed by measures for ensuring
data provenance and integrity, and concluding with techniques for handling sensitive
data securely.
Data Privacy and Encryption
In agentic systems, data privacy and encryption form the first line of defense against
unauthorized access, data breaches, and unintended data exposure. These systems
often interact with multiple data sources-structured databases, real-time user inputs,
and third-party APIs-each introducing potential vulnerabilities. Ensuring that data
