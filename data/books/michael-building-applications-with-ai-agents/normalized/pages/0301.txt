against intentional misuse, adversarial manipulation, and edge-case scenarios. This
approach is especially critical for foundation models, given their probabilistic nature
and susceptibility to subtle prompt manipulations.
At its core, red teaming involves designing and executing adversarial scenarios that
mimic real-world attack strategies. These scenarios can include techniques such as
prompt injection, where attackers craft deceptive inputs to manipulate model behav‐
ior, or jailbreaking, where attempts are made to bypass the model's safety filters and
elicit restricted outputs. Red team exercises also assess the model's behavior under
stress conditions, such as ambiguous instructions, contradictory prompts, highstakes decision-making context, or proclivity to leak sensitive data or violate opera‐
tional constraints.
Figure 12-1 illustrates the iterative lifecycle of red teaming for agent systems, outlin‐
ing the key stages from initial agent implementation through attack execution, evalu‐
ation, and mitigation, with a feedback loop emphasizing continuous refinement.

tem robustness.
This cyclical process ensures vulnerabilities are systematically addressed, adapting to
evolving threats in foundation models and agent behaviors. Red teaming frequently
incorporates the use of language models to create synthetic datasets that intentionally
do not conform to what developers expect to encounter. These datasets-designed to
include anomalous patterns, noisy inputs, biased distributions, or out-of-domain
examples-serve as a powerful stress test for the system's robustness across a wide
range of scenarios. For instance, a foundation model could generate malformed quer‐
ies mimicking real-world user errors particular to your use case or adversarial manip‐
ulations, revealing how the agent handles inputs that deviate from training
assumptions. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of edge cases, going
beyond individual prompts to simulate broader data environments, and can be auto‐
mated for scalability in ongoing evaluations.
To ensure comprehensive coverage, automated red teaming tools are increasingly
used alongside human testers. These tools can systematically generate adversarial
prompts, test thousands of input variations, and evaluate the model's responses at
scale. However, human creativity remains irreplaceable in identifying nuanced vul‐
nerabilities that automated tools might overlook. Several specialized frameworks
