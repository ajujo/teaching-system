Orchestration
Orchestration is what turns isolated capabilities into end-to-end solutions: it's the
logic that composes, schedules, and supervises a series of skills so that each action
flows into the next and works toward a clear objective. At its core, orchestration eval‐
uates possible sequences of tool or skill invocations, forecasts their likely outcomes,
and picks the path most likely to succeed in multistep tasks-whether that's plotting
an optimal delivery route that balances traffic, time windows, and vehicle availability,
or assembling a complex data-processing pipeline.
Because real-world conditions can change in an instant-new information arrives,
priorities shift, or resources become unavailable-an orchestrator must continuously
monitor both progress and environment, pausing or rerouting workflows as needed
to stay on course. In many scenarios, agents build plans incrementally: they execute a
handful of steps, then reassess and update the remaining workflow based on fresh
results. A conversational assistant, for example, might confirm each subtask's out‐
come before planning the next, dynamically adapting its sequence to ensure respon‐
siveness and robustness.
Without a solid orchestration layer, even the most powerful skills risk running at
cross-purposes or stalling entirely. We'll dig into the patterns, architectures, and best
practices for building resilient, flexible orchestration engines in Chapter 5.
Design Trade-Offs
Designing agent-based systems involves balancing multiple trade-offs to optimize
performance, scalability, reliability, and cost. These trade-offs require developers to
make strategic decisions that can significantly impact how the agent performs in realworld environments. This section explores the critical trade-offs involved in creating
effective agent systems and provides guidance on how to approach these challenges.
Performance: Speed/Accuracy Trade-Offs
A key trade-off in agent design is balancing speed and accuracy. High performance
often enables an agent to quickly process information, make decisions, and execute
tasks, but this can come at the expense of precision. Conversely, focusing on accuracy
can slow the agent down, particularly when complex models or computationally
intensive techniques are required.
In real-time environments, such as autonomous vehicles or trading systems, rapid
decision making is essential, with milliseconds sometimes making a critical differ‐
ence; here, prioritizing speed over accuracy may be necessary to ensure timely
responses. However, tasks like legal analysis or medical diagnostics require high pre‐
cision, making it acceptable to sacrifice some speed to ensure reliable results.
