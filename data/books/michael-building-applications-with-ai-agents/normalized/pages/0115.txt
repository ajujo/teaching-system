Weaknesses
High cost
Extensive foundation model use and multiple API calls inflate compute and
token expenses.
Latency
Each layer of planning, decomposition, and reflection adds delay.
Fragility
It is reliant on quality and availability of external data sources and needs careful
error handling and fallback strategies.
The best use cases are long-form, expert-level tasks-academic literature surveys,
technical due diligence, competitive intelligence-where depth and rigor trump
speed.
Table 5-1 offers a snapshot of today's most common agent archetypes-each with its
own trade-offs in speed, flexibility, and complexity. However, this landscape is evolv‐
ing at breakneck speed. New hybrid patterns, metareasoning frameworks, and plan‐
ning strategies are emerging all the time, and the classification of agent types will only
grow more nuanced. Consider this list a starting point rather than a definitive taxon‐
omy: as the field advances, you'll see fresh approaches built on these foundations, so
stay curious, experiment often, and be ready to adapt your orchestration strategies as
the research and tooling continue to mature.

Tool Selection
Before we get to orchestration, we will start with tool selection, because it is the foun‐
dation for more advanced planning. Different approaches to tool selection offer
unique advantages and considerations, meeting different requirements and
