In this, the agent performs tasks and chooses when to invoke tools or submit the
answer. The primary benefits include:
Simplicity
Easier implementation and management
Lower resource requirements
Less computational overhead
Latency
Quicker response for users
Single-agent systems offer a strong starting point for building agentic applications.
Their simplicity, lower cost, and reduced latency make them well suited for many
practical scenarios-especially when the task scope is limited and performance
requirements are tight. While they may not scale well to highly complex or multiface‐
ted tasks, starting with a single-agent architecture enables teams to validate core func‐
tionality quickly and iterate efficiently. Only when the complexity, toolset, or task
coordination needs outgrow the capacity of a single agent should developers consider
transitioning to more sophisticated multiagent systems.
To illustrate, consider a single-agent system for supply chain logistics management.
This agent handles a broad set of tools for inventory, shipping, and supplier tasks in
one unified prompt and graph. While effective for basic queries, performance can
degrade with too many tools, as the agent must select from a large set. Here's how we
set up a single agent with 16 tools:
