CHAPTER 3
User Experience Design for Agentic Systems
As agent systems become an integral part of our digital environments-whether
through chatbots, virtual assistants, or fully autonomous workflows-the user experi‐
ence (UX) they deliver plays a pivotal role in their success. While foundation models
and agent architectures enable remarkable technical capabilities, how users interact
with these agents ultimately determines their effectiveness, trustworthiness, and
adoption. A well-designed agent experience not only empowers users but also builds
confidence, minimizes frustration, and ensures clarity in agent capabilities and limi‐
tations. The field of agent UX is evolving at an unprecedented pace. New interface
paradigms, modality combinations, and user interaction models are emerging almost
monthly. This chapter provides foundational design principles that remain relevant
even as the specific technologies and capabilities continue to advance rapidly. Design‐
ing UX for agent systems introduces unique challenges and opportunities. Agents can
interact through a variety of modalities, including text, graphical interfaces, speech,
and even video.
