predefined rules (e.g., deciding whether to approve or deny a request based on set
criteria).
API-based tools
API-based tools enable agents to interact with external services or data sources.
These tools enable agents to extend their capabilities beyond the local environ‐
ment by fetching real-time data or leveraging third-party systems. For instance, a
virtual assistant might use an API to pull weather data, stock prices, or social
media updates, enabling it to provide more contextual and relevant responses to
user queries.
Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP-based tools enable agents to provide structured, real-time context to lan‐
guage models using the Model Context Protocol, a standardized schema for pass‐
ing external knowledge, memory, and state into the model's prompt. Unlike
traditional API calls that require full round-trip execution, MCP enables agents
to inject rich, dynamic context-such as user profiles, conversation history, world
state, or task-specific metadata-directly into the model's reasoning process
without invoking separate tools. They are particularly effective in reducing
redundant tool use, preserving conversational state, and injecting real-time situa‐
tional awareness into model behavior.
While local tools enable agents to perform tasks independently using internal logic
and rule-based functions, such as calculations or data retrieval from local databases,
API-based tools enable agents to connect with external services. This allows for the
access of real-time data or third-party systems to provide contextually relevant
responses and extended functionality.
Tool Integration and Modularity
Modular design is critical for tool development. Each tool should be designed as a
self-contained module that can be easily integrated or replaced as needed. This
approach enables developers to update or extend the agent's functionality without
overhauling the entire system. A customer service chatbot might start with a basic set
of tools for handling simple queries and later have more complex tools (e.g., dispute
resolution or advanced troubleshooting) added without disrupting the agent's core
operations.
Memory
Memory is an essential component that enables agents to store and retrieve informa‐
tion, enabling them to maintain context, learn from past interactions, and improve
decision making over time. Effective memory management ensures that agents can
