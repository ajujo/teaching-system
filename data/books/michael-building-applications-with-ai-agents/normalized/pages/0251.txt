SigNoz
SigNoz is a unified, OTel-native platform that combines metrics, traces, and logs in a
single tool, suitable for streamlined extensions of basic monitoring setups:
Setup and integration
SigNoz ingests OTel data directly, with auto-instrumentation for Python (e.g.,
LangGraph). Add spans for agent steps (e.g., planning latency) and query via its
UI. Example: trace a multistep agent flow, filtering by token_usage > 1000 to
spot inefficiencies, with built-in evals for LLM quality.
Key features
It has integrated AI-powered insights (e.g., anomaly detection on agent traces);
custom dashboards for LLM metrics (e.g., prompt drift); and lightweight selfhosting with ClickHouse backend for efficiency.
Trade-offs
The pros include a simpler setup (single app), lower overhead for small teams,
and strong OTel support with AI extensions (e.g., 2025 updates for hallucination
auto-scoring). The cons are that it has a less extensible ecosystem (fewer plugins) and that visualization is functional but not as advanced. It is well suited for
startups or ML-focused teams extending lightweight monitoring without heavy
infra additions.
Langfuse
Langfuse specializes in foundation model and agent observability, making it easy to
extend existing stacks with semantic-focused tracing for agents:
Setup and integration
Integrate via SDK in LangGraph (e.g., wrap nodes with Langfuse tracers). It cap‐
tures prompts, outputs, and evals (e.g., custom scorers for coherence). Example:
log a full agent session, auto-evaluate for hallucination, and export traces for
regression testing.
Key features
It has LLM-native metrics (e.g., token cost tracking, A/B testing for prompts);
session replay for debugging; and it is self-hostable with database backends like
PostgreSQL.
Trade-offs
The pros are that it is tailored for agents/LLMs (as built-in evals save custom
work) and easy for dev teams (focus on app-level insights). The cons are that it
has a narrower scope (weaker on infra metrics like CPU; pair with Prometheus)
and it is less scalable for non-LLM telemetry. It is ideal for extending enterprise
logging with agent-specific features without overhauling the core stack.
