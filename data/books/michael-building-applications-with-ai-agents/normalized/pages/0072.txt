AI-enabled, agentic UX will be for other professions-lawyers, accountants, insur‐
ance professionals, product managers, and knowledge workers. The future of work
may not revolve around documents, spreadsheets, and slide decks, but around inter‐
active, agent-driven interfaces purpose-built for decision making, analysis, and
creation.
Speech and Voice Interfaces
Speech and voice interfaces offer users a natural and hands-free way to interact with
agent systems, leveraging spoken language as the primary mode of communication.
From virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri to customer service voice
bots, these interfaces excel in scenarios where manual input is impractical or impossi‐
ble-such as while driving, cooking, or operating machinery. They also provide an
accessible option for users with visual impairments or limited mobility, making agent
systems more inclusive.
Historically, latency has been a major barrier for speech and voice interfaces. Process‐
ing spoken language in real time-including transcribing speech, interpreting intent,
and generating appropriate responses-often led to delays that disrupted conversa‐
tional flow and made voice interfaces feel clunky or robotic. However, the past two
years have seen astonishing advances in this space. New low-latency speech recogni‐
tion models, combined with more efficient language processing architectures, have
dramatically reduced delays. Equally important, the fluidity and capability of voice AI
systems have improved, enabling more natural-sounding interactions that can handle
interruptions, mid-sentence corrections, and shifts in conversation topic.
Graceful handling of interruptions is a particularly important aspect of voice interface
design. Human conversations are rarely linear monologues; people interrupt them‐
selves to clarify, change direction, or refine a request mid-sentence. Effective voice
agents must mirror this conversational flexibility, allowing users to interrupt com‐
mands without confusion, revise their inputs seamlessly, and resume where they left
off without forcing a complete restart. For example, a user might say, "Book me a
table for-oh wait, make that tomorrow instead," and a well-designed agent will adapt
fluidly to incorporate the correction without requiring the user to start the command
again. This capability not only makes interactions feel more natural but also builds
trust and reduces frustration, as users feel the agent is responsive to their real com‐
munication patterns rather than demanding rigid, computer-like inputs.
Another major leap has been the integration of tool use into voice agent workflows.
Modern voice agents are no longer limited to parsing commands and returning static
answers. Instead, they can now pull in external context, update records, and take realtime actions-such as scheduling appointments, changing system configurations, or
placing orders-based on dynamic conversational inputs. This ability to combine
