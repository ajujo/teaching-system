Note-Taking
With this technique, the foundation model is prompted to specifically inject notes on
the input context without trying to answer the question.1 This mimics the way that we
might fill in the margins or summarize a paragraph or section. This note-taking is
performed before the question is presented, and then interleaves these notes with the
original context when attempting to address the current task. Experiments show good
results on multiple reasoning and evaluation tasks, with potential for adaptation to a
wider range of scenarios. As we can see in Figure 6-5, in a traditional, "vanilla"
approach, the model is provided with the context and a question, and it produces an
answer. With chain of thought, it has time to reason about the problem, and only
subsequently generate its answer to the question. With the self-note approach, the
model generates notes on multiple parts of the context, and then generates a note on
the question, before finally moving to generate the final answer. Figure 6-5 illustrates
how note-taking enhances standard inference workflows by interleaving modelgenerated notes alongside the context before producing a final answer.
Figure 6-5. Note-taking workflows. In the standard approach, the model processes con‐
text and question together to produce an answer directly. In the note-taking approach,
the model first generates notes summarizing or elaborating on parts of the context and
the question, and then produces the final answer-enabling deeper reasoning and
improved task performance.
