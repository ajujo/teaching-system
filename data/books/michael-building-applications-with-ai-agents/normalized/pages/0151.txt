Once loaded, your knowledge graph supports multihop traversals (e.g., shortestPath
queries) and rich relationship patterns that far exceed what a flat table or vector store
can express. This foundation enables advanced GraphRAG workflows-where an
agent can traverse the graph at runtime to gather context spanning several degrees of
separation-unlocking truly powerful reasoning over structured knowledge. These
structures make it easy to discover underlying relationships in the data. For instance,
it is now possible to search for elements on the graph, then retrieve all the elements
that are one or more links away from that node. As you can see in Figure 6-4, when
answering complex queries, the controller can traverse the graph and perform multi‐
hop reasoning over structured data, expanding the range and complexity of questions
these types of systems can answer.
