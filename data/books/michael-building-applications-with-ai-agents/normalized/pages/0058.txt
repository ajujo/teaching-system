Correctness
Ensuring that the agent consistently delivers accurate and expected outputs based
on its design
Boundary testing
Evaluating how the agent handles edge cases and extreme inputs, such as very
large datasets, unusual queries, or ambiguous instructions
Task-specific metrics
For agents handling domain-specific tasks (e.g., legal analysis, medical diagnos‐
tics), ensuring the system meets the domain's accuracy and compliance
requirements
For agent systems, particularly those powered by ML models, it is essential to evaluate
the agent's ability to generalize beyond the specific scenarios it was trained on. This
ensures the agent can handle new, unseen situations while maintaining accuracy and
reliability.
Agents often encounter tasks outside of their original training domain. A robust eval‐
uation should test the agent's ability to adapt to these new tasks without requiring
extensive retraining. This is particularly important for general-purpose agents or
those designed to operate in dynamic environments.
User experience is a key factor in determining the success of agent systems. It's
important to evaluate not only the technical performance of the agent but also how
well it meets user expectations in real-world applications.
Collecting feedback from actual users provides critical insights into how well the
agent performs in practice. This feedback helps refine the agent's behaviors, improv‐
ing its effectiveness and user satisfaction, and can consist of the following:
User satisfaction scores
Use metrics like net promoter score (NPS) or customer satisfaction (CSAT) to
gauge how users feel about their interactions with the agent.
Task completion rates
Measure how often users successfully complete tasks with the agent's help. Low
completion rates may indicate confusion or inefficiencies in the agent's design.
Explicit signals
Create opportunities for users to provide their feedback, in such forms as
thumbs-up and thumbs-down, star ratings, and the ability to accept, reject, or
modify the generated results, depending on the context. These signals can pro‐
vide a wealth of insight.
