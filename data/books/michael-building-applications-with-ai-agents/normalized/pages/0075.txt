Looking ahead, we are likely to see significant adoption of advanced voice interfaces
in the coming years, driven by falling costs, reduced latency, improved speech recog‐
nition, and better orchestration with backend tools. In healthcare, voice agents can
assist doctors with hands-free note-taking during patient consultations. In customer
service, they are replacing rigid interactive voice response (IVR) systems with fluid,
humanlike conversations that resolve issues end to end. In industrial applications,
workers can control machinery, log observations, or access manuals without stopping
their tasks.
Ultimately, voice interfaces are most effective for short, hands-free tasks, quick quer‐
ies, and action-oriented workflows, rather than for dense information consumption
or complex decision making that requires rapid skimming or side-by-side
comparison.
When thoughtfully designed, speech and voice interfaces offer unparalleled conve‐
nience, accessibility, and flexibility in agent interactions. As these technologies con‐
tinue to mature and integrate deeply with backend tools and knowledge systems, they
are poised to become indispensable in daily workflows, personal assistants, and enter‐
prise solutions-fundamentally transforming how users interact with AI-powered
agents.
Video-Based Interfaces
Video-based interfaces are an emerging modality for agent interactions, blending vis‐
ual, auditory, and sometimes textual elements into a single cohesive experience.
