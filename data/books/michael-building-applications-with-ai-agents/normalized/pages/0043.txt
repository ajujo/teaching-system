Model Selection
At the heart of every agent-based system lies the model that drives the agent's
decision-making, interaction, and learning capabilities. Selecting the right model is
foundational: it determines how the agent interprets inputs, generates outputs, and
adapts to its environment. This decision influences the system's performance, scala‐
bility, latency, and cost. Choosing an appropriate model depends on the complexity of
the agent's tasks, the nature of the input data, infrastructure constraints, and the
trade-offs between generality, speed, and precision.
Broadly speaking, model selection starts with assessing task complexity. Large foun‐
dation models-such as GPT-5 or Claude Opus 4.1-are well suited for agents oper‐
ating in open-ended environments, where nuanced understanding, flexible reasoning,
and creative generation are essential. These models offer impressive generalization
and excel at tasks involving ambiguity, contextual nuance, or multiple steps. However,
their strengths come at a cost: they require significant computational resources, often
demand cloud infrastructure, and introduce higher latency. They are best reserved for
applications like personal assistants, research agents, or enterprise systems that must
handle a wide range of unpredictable queries.
In contrast, smaller models-such as distilled ModernBERT variants or Phi-4-are
often more appropriate for agents performing well-defined, repetitive tasks. These
models run efficiently on local hardware, respond quickly, and are less expensive to
deploy and maintain. They work well in structured settings like customer support,
information retrieval, or data labeling, where precision is needed but creativity and
flexibility are less important. When real-time responsiveness or resource constraints
are critical, smaller models may outperform their larger counterparts simply by being
more practical.
An increasingly important dimension in model selection is modality. Agents today
often need to process not just text, but also images, audio, or structured data. Multi‐
modal models, such as GPT-5 and Claude 4.1, enable agents to interpret and combine
diverse data types-text, visuals, speech, and more. This expands the agent's utility in
domains like healthcare, robotics, and customer support, where decisions rely on
integrating multiple forms of input. In contrast, text-only models remain ideal for
purely language-driven use cases, offering lower complexity and faster inference in
scenarios where additional modalities provide little added value.
Another key consideration is openness and customizability. Open source models,
such as Llama and DeepSeek, provide developers with full transparency and the abil‐
ity to fine-tune or modify the model as needed. This flexibility is particularly impor‐
tant for privacy-sensitive, regulated, or domain-specific applications. Open source
models can be hosted on private infrastructure, tailored to unique use cases, and
deployed without licensing costs-though they do require more engineering
