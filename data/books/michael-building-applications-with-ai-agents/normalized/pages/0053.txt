Operational costs
After deployment, the operational costs of running agents can become substantial,
particularly for systems requiring high computational power, such as those involving
real-time decision making or continuous data processing. Key contributors to these
expenses include the need for significant compute power, as agents running deep
learning models or complex algorithms often rely on costly hardware like GPUs or
cloud services.
Additionally, agents that process vast amounts of data or maintain extensive memory
incur higher costs for data storage and bandwidth. Regular maintenance and updates,
including bug fixes and system improvements, further add to operational expenses as
resources are needed to ensure the system's reliability and performance over time.
Cost versus value
Ultimately, the cost of an agent-based system must be justified by the value it delivers.
In some cases, it may make sense to prioritize cheaper, simpler agents for less critical
tasks, while investing heavily in more sophisticated agents for mission-critical appli‐
cations. Decisions around cost must be made in the context of the system's overall
goals and expected lifespan. Some optimization strategies include:
Lean models
Using simpler, more efficient models where appropriate can help reduce both
development and operational costs. For example, if a rule-based system can
achieve similar results to a deep learning model for a given task, the simpler
approach will often be more cost-effective.
Cloud-based resources
Leveraging cloud computing resources can reduce up-front infrastructure costs,
establishing a more scalable, pay-as-you-go model.
Open source models and tools
Utilizing open source ML libraries and frameworks can help minimize software
development costs while still delivering high-quality agents.
Designing agent systems involves balancing several critical trade-offs. Prioritizing
performance may require sacrificing some accuracy, while scaling to a multiagent
architecture introduces challenges in coordination and consistency. Ensuring reliabil‐
ity demands rigorous testing and monitoring but can increase development time and
complexity. Finally, cost considerations must be factored in from both a development
and operational perspective, ensuring that the system delivers value within budget
constraints. In the next section, we'll review some of the most common design pat‐
terns used when building effective agentic systems.
