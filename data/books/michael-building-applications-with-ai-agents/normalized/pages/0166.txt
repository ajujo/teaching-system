Figure 7-4. Experiential learning with insight extraction and distillation. The agent
begins by gathering experiences into an experience pool. Multiple model evaluations are
then used to extract insights from these experiences, aggregating and distilling them into
a concise set of general, high-level critiques and rules. These distilled insights guide
future decisions, enabling the agent to improve its performance across tasks over time.
In this next section, we see how these rules are actually created, promoted, modified,
and removed to enable the agent to improve its performance on the task over time:
def promote_insight(self, insight):
       if insight in self.insights:
           self.insights.remove(insight)
           self.promoted_insights.append(insight)
           print(f"Promoted: {insight}")
       else:
           print(f"Insight '{insight}' not found in insights.")
   def demote_insight(self, insight):
       if insight in self.promoted_insights:
           self.promoted_insights.remove(insight)
           self.demoted_insights.append(insight)
           print(f"Demoted: {insight}")
       else:
           print(f"Insight '{insight}' not found in promoted insights.")
   def edit_insight(self, old_insight, new_insight):
       # Check in all lists
       if old_insight in self.insights:
           index = self.insights.index(old_insight)
           self.insights[index] = new_insight
       elif old_insight in self.promoted_insights:
           index = self.promoted_insights.index(old_insight)
           self.promoted_insights[index] = new_insight
       elif old_insight in self.demoted_insights:
           index = self.demoted_insights.index(old_insight)
           self.demoted_insights[index] = new_insight
       else:
