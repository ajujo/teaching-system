Architecture Design Patterns
The architectural design of agent-based systems determines how agents are struc‐
tured, how they interact with their environment, and how they perform tasks. The
choice of architecture influences the system's scalability, maintainability, and flexibil‐
ity. This section explores three common design patterns for agent-based systemssingle-agent and multiagent architectures-and discusses their advantages, chal‐
lenges, and appropriate use cases. We'll discuss this in far more detail in Chapter 8.
Single-Agent Architectures
A single-agent architecture is among the simplest and most straightforward designs,
where a single agent is responsible for managing and executing all tasks within a sys‐
tem. This agent interacts directly with its environment and independently handles
decision making, planning, and execution without relying on other agents.
Ideal for well-defined and narrow tasks, this architecture is best suited for workloads
that are manageable by a single entity. The simplicity of single-agent systems makes
them easy to design, develop, and deploy, as they avoid complexities related to coor‐
dination, communication, and synchronization across multiple components. With
clear use cases, single-agent architectures excel in narrow-scope tasks that do not
require collaboration or distributed efforts, such as simple chatbots handling basic
customer queries (like FAQs and order tracking) and task-specific automation for
data entry or file management.
Single-agent setups work well in environments where the problem domain is welldefined, tasks are straightforward, and there is no significant need for scaling. This
makes them a fit for customer service chatbots, general-purpose assistants, and code
generation agents. We'll discuss single-agent and multiagent architectures much more
in Chapter 8.
Multiagent Architectures: Collaboration, Parallelism,
and Coordination
In multiagent architectures, multiple agents work together to achieve a common goal.
These agents may operate independently, in parallel, or through coordinated efforts,
depending on the nature of the tasks. Multiagent systems are often used in complex
environments where different aspects of a task need to be managed by specialized
agents or where parallel processing can improve efficiency and scalability, and they
bring many advantages:
Collaboration and specialization
Each agent in a multiagent system can be designed to specialize in specific tasks
or areas. For example, one agent may focus on data collection while another
