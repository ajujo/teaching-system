CHAPTER 6
Knowledge and Memory
Now that your agent has tools and orchestration, it is more than capable of taking
actions to do real work. In most cases, though, you will want your agents to both
remember what's happened and know additional information beyond what lives in
the model's weights. In this chapter, we'll focus on knowledge and memory-two
complementary but distinct ways to enrich your agent's context. Knowledge (often
implemented via retrieval-augmented generation) pulls in factual or domain-specific
content-technical specs, policy documents, product catalogs, customer or system
logs-at generation time so the agent "knows" verifiable information beyond the
immediate conversation to complement the information stored in the model itself,
specifically in its weights and biases. Memory, on the other hand, captures the agent's
own history: prior user exchanges, tool outputs, and state updates. It lets your agent
maintain continuity across turns and sessions so that it "remembers" past interactions
and uses that history to inform future decisions.
In Chapter 5, we introduced context engineering as the discipline of dynamically
selecting, structuring, and assembling all inputs into the model's context window to
produce the best outcomes. Memory is a foundational enabler of context engineering:
it provides the knowledge, history, and facts that can be selected and assembled into
effective prompts. In other words, memory is where knowledge is stored, while con‐
text engineering is how that knowledge is leveraged to produce intelligent behavior.
This chapter will offer examples in LangGraph, a low-level orchestration framework
for building stateful agentic workflows that was introduced in Chapter 1. LangGraph
defines your application as a directed graph of nodes (pure functions such as founda‐
tion model calls, memory updates, or tool invocations) and edges (control-flow tran‐
sitions), enabling developers to model complex, multistep processes declaratively.
LangGraph treats your entire application state as a single, strongly typed Python
object (often a TypedDict) that flows through the graph at runtime, keeping data
