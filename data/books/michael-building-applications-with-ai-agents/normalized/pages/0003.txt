Praise for Building Applications with AI Agents
Finally, a book about really scaling AI into the human workforce. Michael does a great job
leveraging his expertise at scalable organizations like Uber and Microsoft to teach any
technical leader in a small and medium business how to really create scalable agentic
solutions for their transformation.

As a clinician working at the intersection of medicine and technology, I found this to be
an essential read for anyone building AI agents-clear, practical, and rich with insight
into tools, orchestration, and design patterns relevant to healthcare use cases like intake,
triage, and workflow integration.
