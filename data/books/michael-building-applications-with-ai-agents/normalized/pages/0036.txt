AutoGen
Strengths
Powerful multiagent orchestration; dynamic role assignment; flexible messagingbased interaction between agents
Trade-offs
Can be heavyweight or complex for simple use cases; more opinionated around
agent interaction patterns
Best for
Research and production systems involving dialogue between multiple agents
(e.g., manager-worker, self-reflection loops)
CrewAI
Strengths
Easy to learn and use; quick setup for prototyping; useful abstractions like "crew"
and "tasks"
Trade-offs
Limited customization and control over orchestration internals; less mature than
LangGraph or AutoGen for complex workflows
Best for
Developers who want to get started quickly on practical, human-centric agents
like assistants or support agents
OpenAI Agents Software Development Kit (SDK)
Strengths
Deep integration with OpenAI's tool ecosystem; secure and easy-to-use function
calling, memory primitives, and tool routing
Trade-offs
Tightly coupled to OpenAI's infrastructure; may be less flexible or portable for
custom agent stacks or open source toolchains
Best for
Teams already using the OpenAI API and looking for a fast way to build secure,
tool-using agents with minimal scaffolding
