These interfaces can range from video avatars that simulate face-to-face conversations
to agents embedded in real-time video collaboration tools. As video becomes more
pervasive in our digital lives-through platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and
virtual event spaces-agents are finding new ways to integrate into these environ‐
ments. While many of these experiences are still in the uncanny valley, the rapid pace
of improvement suggests that this technology is getting closer to prime time, and
more teams will begin building experiences around it.
One of the core strengths of video interfaces is their ability to combine multiple sen‐
sory channels-visual cues, speech, text overlays, and animations-into a richer,
more expressive interaction. Video agents can mimic humanlike expressions and ges‐
tures, adding emotional nuance to their communication. For example, an AI-
powered customer service avatar might use facial expressions and hand gestures to
reassure a frustrated customer, complementing its spoken responses with visual
empathy.
However, video interfaces come with technical and design challenges. High-quality
video interactions require significant processing power and bandwidth, which can
introduce lag or pixelation, undermining the user experience. The uncanny valley
remains a risk-if an agent's facial expressions, gestures, or lip-syncing feel slightly
off, it can create discomfort rather than engagement. Additionally, privacy concerns
are amplified with video agents, as users may feel uneasy about sharing visual data
with AI systems.
Looking ahead, video interfaces are poised for significant growth, especially as
improvements in rendering, real-time animation, and bandwidth optimization
address current limitations. In the near future, expect to see agents embedded seam‐
lessly into virtual meetings, augmented reality (AR) overlays, and digital customer
service avatars.
When thoughtfully executed, video interfaces offer an engaging, humanlike dimen‐
sion to agent interactions, enhancing clarity, emotional connection, and overall effec‐
tiveness. As technology advances, video-based agents are set to play a larger role in
industries such as telehealth, education, remote collaboration, and interactive enter‐
tainment, reshaping how humans and agents communicate in immersive digital
spaces.
Combining Modalities for Seamless Experiences
While each interaction modality-text, graphical interfaces, voice, and video-has its
own strengths and limitations, the most compelling agentic experiences often com‐
bine multiple modalities into a single, cohesive user journey. Users don't think in
terms of modality boundaries; they simply want to achieve their goals as effortlessly
and naturally as possible. The ability to move seamlessly across modalities-main‐
taining state and context throughout-is a hallmark of great agent system design.
