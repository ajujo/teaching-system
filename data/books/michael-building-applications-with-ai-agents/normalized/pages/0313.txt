integrating with anomaly detection to flag unusual inter-subnet communications.
This architecture not only enforces perimeter security but also enables granular con‐
trols like ACLs on routers and mTLS for inter-component communication, reducing
the risk of lateral movement by attackers who breach the outer layers.

At the forefront of external threat protection is network security. Agents must operate
within protected network boundaries, using technologies such as firewalls and intru‐
sion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to filter malicious traffic and block
unauthorized access attempts. Endpoints where agents interact with external APIs or
services must enforce mTLS authentication to ensure both sides of the connection are
verified. Additionally, rate limiting and throttling controls should be implemented on
public-facing interfaces to prevent resource exhaustion caused by excessive API
requests or malicious traffic surges.
Authentication and authorization mechanisms are also critical safeguards against
external threats. Agents must enforce strict identity verification protocols, such as
OAuth 2.0 or API keys, to ensure only authorized users and services can interact with
them. RBAC should extend to external systems, limiting what each external entity can
access and how they can interact with the agent.
A particularly insidious external threat comes from supply chain attacks, where mali‐
cious code or vulnerabilities are introduced through third-party libraries, plug-ins, or
dependencies. To mitigate this risk, agent systems should adopt software composition
analysis (SCA) tools that continuously scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
and enforce signature verification for third-party integrations. Additionally, organiza‐
tions should maintain a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track all third-party
components and their security statuses.
Adversarial attacks-including prompt injection, data poisoning, and manipulation
through ambiguous inputs-require specialized defenses. Input validation pipelines
should sanitize all incoming data to prevent malicious prompts from reaching the
agent's reasoning layer. For example, adversarial inputs designed to trick the agent
