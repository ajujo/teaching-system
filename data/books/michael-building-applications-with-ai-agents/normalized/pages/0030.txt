Healthcare patient intake and triage agent
These agents support frontline healthcare operations by registering new patients,
verifying insurance, assessing symptoms to prioritize care, scheduling appoint‐
ments, managing medical histories, and coordinating referrals, thereby improv‐
ing workflow efficiency and patient outcomes.
IT help desk agent
IT help desk agents manage user access, troubleshoot network and system issues,
deploy software updates, respond to security incidents, and escalate unresolved
issues to specialists. They enhance productivity by resolving common technical
problems swiftly.
Legal document review agent
Legal agents assist attorneys and paralegals by reviewing contracts, conducting
legal research, performing client intake and conflict checks, managing discovery,
assessing compliance, calculating damages, and tracking deadlines. This helps to
streamline workflows and improve accuracy in legal operations.
Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst agent
SOC analyst agents investigate security alerts, gather threat intelligence, query
logs, triage incidents, isolate compromised hosts, and provide updates to security
teams. They accelerate incident response and strengthen organizational security
posture.
Supply chain and logistics agent
In supply chain management, agents optimize inventory, track shipments, evalu‐
ate suppliers, coordinate warehouse operations, forecast demand, manage dis‐
ruptions, and handle compliance requirements. These capabilities help maintain
resilience and efficiency across global networks.
Autonomous agents offer significant potential across various use cases, from cus‐
tomer support and personal assistance to legal services and advertising. By integrat‐
ing these agents into their operations, organizations can achieve greater efficiency,
improve service quality, and unlock new opportunities for innovation and growth. As
we continue to explore the capabilities and applications of autonomous agents in this
book, it becomes evident that their impact will be profound and far-reaching across
multiple industries.
Now that we've looked at some example agents, in the next section, we'll discuss some
of the key considerations when designing our agentic systems.
Workflows and Agents
In many real‐world projects, choosing between a simple script, a deterministic work‐
flow, a traditional chatbot, a retrieval‐augmented generation (RAG) system, or a
