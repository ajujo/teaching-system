Text-Based
Text-based interfaces are one of the most common and versatile ways users interact
with agent systems-found in everything from customer service chatbots and
command-line tools to productivity assistants integrated into messaging platforms.
Their widespread adoption can be attributed to their simplicity, familiarity, and ease
of integration into existing workflows. Text interfaces offer a unique advantage: they
can support both synchronous conversations (in real time) and asynchronous inter‐
actions (where users can return to the conversation at their convenience without los‐
ing context). Additionally, text interactions create a clear and traceable record of
exchanges, enabling transparency, accountability, and easier troubleshooting when
something goes wrong.
In recent years, the text-based modality has undergone a renaissance driven by the
integration of advanced AI capabilities within terminal environments. Tools like
Warp, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI illustrate this shift vividly. Warp reimagines the
traditional developer terminal by integrating natural language command translation,
intelligent autocompletion, and context-aware explanations, turning the command
line into a collaborative, AI-augmented workspace. To illustrate this trend, Figure 3-1
shows an example of an AI-enabled terminal interface inspired by modern tools like
Claude Code and Gemini CLI. This demonstration captures how developers can
interact with the terminal using natural language prompts to generate, run, and
debug commands seamlessly, without memorizing complex syntax or flags.
Similarly, Claude Code and Gemini CLI extend natural language interactions to code
generation, execution, and file manipulation directly within terminal workflows, ena‐
bling developers to perform complex tasks by simply describing their goals in plain
English. This figure highlights how AI is revitalizing the humble terminal, transform‐
ing it from a tool accessible only to those with deep command-line expertise into an
approachable, powerful gateway for both novice and expert users to interact with sys‐
tems through natural language.
This trend reflects a broader rethinking of what text-based interfaces can achieve.
The incredible natural language understanding capabilities of modern foundation
models are making ordinary text-based interactions more powerful than ever before.
Where traditional terminals required precise syntax knowledge and memorization of
command flags, AI terminals now act as conversational partners, interpreting user
intent, suggesting best practices, and even debugging errors in real time. This shift is
democratizing access to powerful systems operations, scripting, and data workflows,
making the terminal "new again" as an accessible, intelligent gateway for both novice
and expert users.
