CHAPTER 5
Orchestration
Now that your agent has a set of tools that can be used, it's time to orchestrate them to
solve real tasks. Orchestration involves more than just deciding which tools to call
and when-it also requires constructing the right context for each model invocation
to ensure effective, grounded actions. While simple tasks may only need a single tool
and minimal context, more complex workflows demand careful planning, memory
retrieval, and dynamic context assembly to perform each step accurately. In this chap‐
ter, we'll cover orchestration strategies, context engineering, tool selection, execution,
and planning topologies to build agents capable of handling realistic, multistep tasks
efficiently and reliably. As we can see in Figure 5-1, orchestration is how the system
utilizes the resources at its disposal to address the user query effectively.
Figure 5-1. Orchestration as the core logic that handles user queries and coordinates calls
to the foundation models, external and local tools, and to various databases to retrieve
additional information.
