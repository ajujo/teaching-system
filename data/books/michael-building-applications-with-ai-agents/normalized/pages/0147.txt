1. Data collection
The first step in building a knowledge graph is gathering the necessary data. This
data can come from various sources, including databases, text documents, web‐
sites, and even user-generated content. It's crucial to ensure the diversity and
quality of sources to cover a broad spectrum of knowledge. For an organization,
this may consist of a set of core policies or documents that contain core informa‐
tion to influence the agent.
2. Data preprocessing
Once data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This step involves
removing irrelevant or redundant information, correcting errors, and standardiz‐
ing data formats. Preprocessing is vital for reducing noise in the data and
improving the accuracy of the subsequent entity extraction process.
3. Entity recognition and extraction
This process involves identifying key elements (entities) from the data that will
serve as nodes in the knowledge graph. Common entities include people, places,
organizations, and concepts. Techniques such as named entity recognition (NER)
are typically used, which may involve ML models trained on large datasets to rec‐
ognize and categorize entities accurately.
4. Relationship extraction
After identifying entities, the next step is to determine the relationships between
them. This involves parsing data to extract predicates that connect entities, form‐
ing the edges of the graph. Relationship extraction can be challenging, especially
in unstructured data, though foundation models have shown improving efficacy
over time.
5. Ontology design
An ontology defines the categories and relationships within the knowledge
graph, serving as its backbone. Designing an ontology involves defining a schema
that encapsulates the types of entities and the possible types of relationships
between them. This schema helps in organizing the knowledge graph systemati‐
cally and supports more effective querying and data retrieval.
6. Graph population
With the ontology in place, the next step is to populate the graph with the extrac‐
ted entities and their relationships. This involves creating nodes and edges in the
graph database according to the ontology's structure. Databases like Neo4j, Ori‐
entDB, or Amazon Neptune can be used to manage these data structures
efficiently.
