plug-in tools expand, we can expect AI agents to become even more capable and ver‐
satile. The ongoing research and development efforts by leading platforms and the
open source community will drive innovation, resulting in more powerful and
sophisticated tools for AI development. One important area of focus for the future is
the interoperability and standardization of plug-in tools. Establishing common
standards and protocols for plug-in tools will facilitate seamless integration and inter‐
operability across different AI platforms and systems. This will enable developers to
leverage plug-in tools from various sources, creating more flexible and adaptable AI
solutions. Efforts are also being made to enhance the customization and adaptability
of plug-in tools. Future plug-in tools may offer more configurable options, enabling
developers to tailor them to specific use cases and requirements. This will bridge the
gap between the ease of integration and the need for customized solutions, providing
the best of both worlds.
Model Context Protocol
As the AI ecosystem matures, agents no longer live in isolated silos. They need to
read documents from cloud storage, push data to business applications, call internal
APIs, and coordinate with other agents. Custom integrations-where you write
bespoke adapters for each data source or service-are brittle and scale poorly. Enter
the Model Context Protocol (MCP): an open standard introduced by Anthropic (and
since adopted by major players like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Microsoft) that
provides a uniform, model-agnostic way to connect LLMs to external systems. Think
of MCP as a "USB-C port for AI"-a single, well-defined interface that any data
source or tool can expose, and any agent can consume, without specialized glue code.
At its core, MCP defines two roles:
MCP server
This is a web server that exposes data or services via a standardized JSON-RPC
2.0 interface. A server can wrap anything-cloud object storage, SQL databases,
enterprise customer relationship management, proprietary business logic-so
long as it implements the MCP specification.
MCP client
This is any agent or LLM application that "speaks" MCP. The client sends JSON-
RPC requests (e.g., "List all files in this Salesforce folder," or "Execute function
'getCustomerBalance' with customerId=1234") and receives structured JSON
responses. Because the protocol is uniform, an agent developer doesn't need to
know the internals of the server-only its exposed methods.
Under the hood, MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTPS or WebSocket. Servers adver‐
tise their available methods (e.g., listFiles, getRecord, runAnalysis) and their
input/output schemas. Clients fetch the server's "method catalog," allowing an LLM to
reason about which method to call and with what parameters. Once the tool call is
