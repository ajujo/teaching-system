Implicit signals
Analyze user-agent interactions to identify common points of failure, such as
misinterpretations, delays, sentiment, or inappropriate responses. Interaction
logs can be mined for insights into areas where the agent needs improvement.
In some cases, it's necessary to involve human experts in the evaluation process to
assess the agent's decision-making accuracy. Human-in-the-loop validation combines
automated evaluation with human judgment, ensuring that the agent's performance
aligns with real-world standards. When feasible, human experts should review a sam‐
ple of the agent's outputs to verify correctness, ethical compliance, and alignment
with best practices, and these reviews can then be used to calibrate and improve auto‐
mated evaluations.
We should evaluate agents in environments that closely simulate their real-world
applications. This helps ensure that the system can perform reliably outside of con‐
trolled development conditions. Evaluate the agent across the full spectrum of its
operational environment, from data ingestion and processing to task execution and
output generation. End-to-end testing ensures that the agent functions as expected
across multiple systems, data sources, and platforms.
Real-World Testing
While building agents in a controlled development environment is crucial for initial
testing, it's equally important to validate agents in real-world settings to ensure they
perform as expected when interacting with live users or environments. Real-world
testing involves deploying agents in actual production environments and observing
their behavior under real-life conditions. This stage of testing enables developers to
uncover issues that may not have surfaced during earlier development stages and to
evaluate the agent's robustness, reliability, and user impact.
Real-world testing is essential for ensuring agents can manage the unpredictability
and complexity of live environments. Unlike controlled testing, this approach reveals
edge cases, unexpected user inputs, and performance under high demand, helping
developers refine the agent for robust, reliable operation:
Exposure to real-world complexity
In controlled environments, agents operate with predictable inputs and respon‐
ses. However, real-world environments are dynamic and unpredictable, with
diverse users, edge cases, and unforeseen challenges. Testing in these environ‐
ments ensures that the agent can handle the complexity and variability of realworld scenarios.
Uncovering edge cases
Real-world interactions often expose edge cases that may not have been accoun‐
ted for in the design or testing phases. For example, a chatbot tested with scripted
