example-graphrag) unpack the same end‑to‑end pipeline in just a few hundred lines
of Python. This system leverages the power of graph databases or knowledge graphs
to store and query interconnected data. In GraphRAG, the retrieval phase doesn't just
pull relevant documents or snippets; it analyzes and retrieves nodes and edges from a
graph that represents complex relationships and contexts within the data. GraphRAG
consists of the following three components:
Knowledge graph
This component stores data in a graph format, where entities (nodes) and their
relationships (edges) are explicitly defined. Graph databases are highly efficient at
managing connected data and supporting complex queries that involve multiple
hops or relationships.
Retrieval system
The retrieval system in GraphRAG is designed to query the graph database effi‐
ciently, extracting subgraphs or clusters of nodes that are most relevant to the
input query or context.
Generative model
Once relevant data is retrieved in the form of a graph, the generative model syn‐
thesizes this information to create coherent and contextually rich responses.
GraphRAG represents a significant leap forward in the capabilities of agentic systems,
offering sophisticated tools to handle and generate responses based on complex inter‐
connected data. As this technology evolves, it promises to open new frontiers in AI
applications, making systems smarter, more context-aware, and capable of handling
increasingly complex tasks. Using knowledge graphs in GraphRAG systems trans‐
forms the way information is retrieved and utilized for generation, enabling more
intelligent, contextual, and accurate responses across various applications. We will
not cover the details of the algorithm here, but multiple open source implementations
of GraphRAG are now available, and setting them up on your dataset is easier to do.
If you have a large set of data you need to reason over, and standard chunking with a
vector retrieval is running into limitations, GraphRAG is a more expensive and com‐
plex approach that frequently produces better results in practice.
Building Knowledge Graphs
Knowledge graphs are fundamental in providing structured and semantically rich
information that enhances the capabilities of intelligent systems, including Graph‐
RAG systems. Building an effective knowledge graph involves a series of steps, from
data collection and processing to integration and maintenance. This section will
cover the methodology for constructing knowledge graphs that can significantly
impact the performance of GraphRAG systems. This process consists of several steps:
