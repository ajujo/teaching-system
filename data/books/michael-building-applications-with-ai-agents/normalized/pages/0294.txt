challenges posed by autonomous agents, including goal misalignment, human over‐
sight limitations, and emerging threat vectors targeting AI models. The chapter then
delves into strategies to secure foundation models through careful model selection,
proactive defensive measures, and rigorous red teaming.
By the end of this chapter, readers will have a robust understanding of the security
landscape specific to agent systems and practical strategies to safeguard these power‐
ful but vulnerable technologies.
The Unique Risks of Agentic Systems
Agentic systems represent a significant leap forward from traditional software by
offering autonomous decision making, adaptability, and operational flexibility. These
strengths, however, introduce distinct risks:
Goal misalignment
Agents may interpret their objectives differently than intended, especially when
tasked with vague or ambiguous instructions. For example, an agent optimizing
user engagement might inadvertently prioritize sensational content, undermin‐
ing user trust or well-being.
Probabilistic reasoning
Unlike deterministic systems, agents rely on large-scale foundation models
whose outputs are inherently probabilistic. This can result in unintended behav‐
iors such as "hallucinations," where the agent generates plausible-sounding yet
incorrect or misleading information.
Dynamic adaptation
Autonomous agents continuously adapt to changing environments, complicating
the task of predicting and controlling their behavior. Even minor variations in
input data or context can significantly alter their decisions and actions.
Limited visibility
Agents often operate with incomplete information or ambiguous data, creating
uncertainty that can lead to suboptimal or harmful decisions.
Addressing these inherent risks requires carefully designed controls, continuous
monitoring, and proactive oversight to ensure alignment with human intent. Human
oversight is commonly employed as a safeguard against the unintended consequences
of agent autonomy. However, HITL systems introduce their own set of vulnerabilities:
Automation bias
Humans may over-trust agent recommendations, failing to adequately scrutinize
outputs, especially if presented with high confidence.
