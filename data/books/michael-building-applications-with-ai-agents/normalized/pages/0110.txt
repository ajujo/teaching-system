• Log everything-prompts, tool calls, validation errors, retries, fallbacks-for
observability, debugging, and continuous improvement.
By validating outputs, retrying strategically, and falling back gracefully-all while log‐
ging every step-you transform random failures into manageable, predictable behav‐
ior. This shift is essential for delivering robust, production-grade agents.
Conclusion
Tools enable AI agents to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their envi‐
ronment effectively. These range from simple to complex tasks requiring advanced
reasoning. Handcrafted tools, manually designed by developers, offer precision but
can be time-consuming to maintain. Plug-in tools, provided by platforms like
OpenAI and Google's Gemini, enable rapid integration and scalability but lack
customizability.
Automated tool development, including real-time code generation, imitation learn‐
ing, and reinforcement learning, allows AI agents to dynamically adapt and refine
their abilities. This enhances their versatility and problem-solving capabilities, ena‐
bling continuous improvement and autonomous expansion of tools. Building and
maintaining the toolkit for your agent is one of the most critical ways to give your
agent the capabilities to succeed in the task at hand.
Now that we know how to build and curate a set of tools that we provide to our agent,
we'll move on to consider how we'll enable the agent to make plans, select and
parameterize tools, and put these pieces together to perform useful work. In the next
chapter, we'll discuss how we can organize a sequence of tools to perform complex
tasks in a process we call orchestration.
