clause, which lets you specify nodes with labels and properties and then link them via
directed relationships. Best practice is to first load or match existing nodes-ensuring
you don't duplicate entities-and then issue separate CREATE statements for each rela‐
tionship, as shown in the following example. By organizing your script into discrete
steps (create nodes → match nodes → create relationships), you maintain clarity and
can more easily debug or extend your graph as it grows:
// Create nodes for concepts and entities
CREATE (:Concept {name: 'Artificial Intelligence'});
CREATE (:Concept {name: 'Machine Learning'});
CREATE (:Concept {name: 'Deep Learning'});
CREATE (:Concept {name: 'Neural Networks'});
CREATE (:Concept {name: 'Computer Vision'});
CREATE (:Concept {name: 'Natural Language Processing'});
CREATE (:Tool {name: 'TensorFlow', creator: 'Google'});
CREATE (:Tool {name: 'PyTorch', creator: 'Facebook'});
CREATE (:Model {name: 'BERT', year: 2018});
CREATE (:Model {name: 'ResNet', year: 2015});
// Create relationships between concepts
MATCH
  (ai:Concept {name:'Artificial Intelligence'}),
  (ml:Concept {name:'Machine Learning'})
CREATE (ml)-[:SUBSET_OF]->(ai);
MATCH
  (ml:Concept {name:'Machine Learning'}),
  (dl:Concept {name:'Deep Learning'})
CREATE (dl)-[:SUBSET_OF]->(ml);
MATCH
  (dl:Concept {name:'Deep Learning'}),
  (nn:Concept {name:'Neural Networks'})
CREATE (nn)-[:USED_IN]->(dl);
MATCH
  (ai:Concept {name:'Artificial Intelligence'}),
  (cv:Concept {name:'Computer Vision'})
CREATE (cv)-[:APPLICATION_OF]->(ai);
MATCH
  (ai:Concept {name:'Artificial Intelligence'}),
  (nlp:Concept {name:'Natural Language Processing'})
CREATE (nlp)-[:APPLICATION_OF]->(ai);
// Create relationships to tools and models
MATCH
  (tensorflow:Tool {name:'TensorFlow'}),
  (nn:Concept {name:'Neural Networks'})
CREATE (tensorflow)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(nn);
