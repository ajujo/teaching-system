illustrated with real-world case studies, supported by references, and reviewed by
practitioners in the field. Sections on advanced topics-like agent architectures, tool
integration, memory systems, orchestration, multiagent coordination, measurement,
monitoring, security, and ethical considerations-are further refined by expert input.
Writing this book has been a journey of discovery for me as well. The initial drafts
sparked conversations that challenged my views and introduced new ideas. I hope
this process continues as you read it, bringing your own insights. Feel free to share
any feedback you might have for this book via Twitter (X), LinkedIn, my personal

What This Book Is About
This book provides a practical framework for building robust applications using AI
agents. It addresses key challenges and offers solutions to questions such as:
• What defines an AI agent, and when should I use one? How do agents differ from
traditional machine learning (ML) systems?
• How do I design agent architectures for specific use cases, including scenario
selection, and core components like tools, memory, planning, and orchestration?
• What are effective strategies for agent planning, reasoning, execution, tool selec‐
tion, and topologies like chains, trees, and graphs?
• How can I enable agents to learn from experience through nonparametric meth‐
ods, fine-tuning, and transfer learning?
• How do I scale from single-agent to multiagent systems, including coordination
patterns like democratic, hierarchical, or actor-critic approaches?
• How do I evaluate and improve agent performance with metrics, testing, and
production monitoring?
• What tools and frameworks are best for development, deployment, and securing
agents against risks?
• How do I ensure agents are safe, ethical, and scalable, with considerations for
user experience (UX), trust, bias, fairness, and regulatory compliance?
The content draws from established engineering principles and emerging practices in
AI agents, with case studies (such as customer support, personal assistants, legal,
advertising, and code review agents) and discussions on trade-offs to help you tailor
solutions to your needs.
