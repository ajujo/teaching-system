Communicating Agent Capabilities
One of the most critical aspects of designing effective agent experiences is ensuring
users understand what the agent can do and how to interact with it effectively. While
backend agent design determines what functions an agent supports, the user experi‐
ence determines whether those capabilities are discoverable, intuitive, and usable in
practice. In traditional applications, discoverability is straightforward: menus, but‐
tons, and interface elements visually communicate available actions. In agentic sys‐
tems, especially those using text or voice interfaces, the absence of visible affordances
often leaves users guessing what the agent can and cannot do.
Effective agent UX addresses this challenge by proactively communicating capabili‐
ties through the interface itself. For example, many chat-based agents include sug‐
gested action buttons below the input field, highlighting common or contextually
relevant actions such as "Track order," "Generate summary," or "Create meeting note."
These buttons serve as visual affordances, guiding users toward supported workflows
without requiring them to remember specific commands or guess what is possible.
Similarly, onboarding tutorials or first-use walkthroughs can introduce users to an
agent's core functions, helping them build confidence early on.
Another useful pattern is the inclusion of expandable menus or capability cards that
list available functions in a structured way. In a graphical agent interface, for instance,
a sidebar might contain sections for data retrieval, analysis, summarization, and
workflow automation. This mirrors the menu structures that users expect in tradi‐
tional apps while communicating the breadth of agent capabilities upfront. Dynamic
suggestions, where the system recommends actions based on user input, also help
bridge the gap between open-ended natural language and structured tool invocation.
If a user begins typing "book...," the agent might suggest "Book meeting with
[name]," "Book conference room," or "Book travel," anticipating intent and making
actions easier to execute.
In systems relying primarily on open-ended text input, agents themselves must com‐
municate their capabilities clearly in conversation. This can include proactive intro‐
ductions when a session begins, such as: "Hi, I can help you generate content, analyze
data, or summarize documents. What would you like to do today?" When users
request actions beyond current capabilities, the agent should not simply reject the
request but provide alternatives: "I can't process payments directly, but I can update
your billing preferences or connect you with an agent who can assist." Such responses
reduce user frustration while reinforcing the agent's utility.
While it is important to surface capabilities, it is equally critical not to overwhelm
users with too many options at once. Effective designs prioritize progressive disclo‐
sure, showing core capabilities initially and revealing advanced features as users
become more comfortable. Contextual relevance also plays a key role. Displaying the
