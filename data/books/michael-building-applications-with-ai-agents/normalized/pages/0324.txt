By recognizing the different scopes at which agents operate and designing accord‐
ingly, organizations can safely and effectively unlock their full potential-from indi‐
vidual productivity to systemic transformation.
Agent Scope and Organizational Roles
Not all agents are created equal-or rather, not all are created to serve the same entity.
As organizations scale their use of agentic systems, they naturally adopt agents that
operate at different levels of abstraction and authority. Understanding and intention‐
ally designing around these scopes is critical for safe, effective deployment. Agent
deployments typically fall into one of five scopes, as shown in Table 13-2. As agents
scale from personal assistants to organizational systems, their access scope, decision
autonomy, and stakeholder impact increase. Each scope requires tailored design
choices for permissions, oversight, and context management.

Each scope comes with different requirements for autonomy, oversight, data access,
and trust calibration. For example, a personal agent can take small risks with limited
scope, while an organizational agent must operate with rigorous guardrails, explaina‐
bility, and auditing.
The first and most critical implication is the need for differentiated access control. As
agents expand in scope, they must adhere to increasingly strict role-based access con‐
trols (RBAC) that align with their responsibilities and the sensitivity of the data they
touch.
Personal agents may inherit permissions from the individual they assist, while func‐
tional or organizational agents require explicit privileges that reflect their designated
role within enterprise systems. Designing this access architecture demands
