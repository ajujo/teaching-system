Vigilant oversight
Teams must watch for pathological feedback loops or exploitation of short-term
trends at the expense of long-term objectives.
Bayesian Bandits shine in fluid, data-rich agentic worlds-think real-time personali‐
zation in recommendation agents or adaptive workflows in autonomous teamsdelivering faster, smarter evolution than traditional methods.
Continuous Learning
We now move to continuous learning, where the agentic system is designed to adapt,
improve, and optimize performance over time based on real-world interactions, feed‐
back, and evolving user needs. Unlike static models or prescripted workflows, contin‐
uously learning agents are designed to ingest new data, refine their behavior, and
update reasoning strategies dynamically. This process blends automated adaptation
with carefully managed oversight to prevent unintended consequences, such as over‐
fitting to short-term trends or introducing regressions.
Continuous learning encompasses two core mechanisms: in-context learning and
online learning. These enable improvements at varying scales-from real-time tweaks
within a session to incremental updates across workflows. As discussed in Chapter 7,
these build on foundational nonparametric techniques (e.g., exemplar retrieval,
Reflexion) and can incorporate parametric methods like fine-tuning where appropri‐
ate. Here, we emphasize integrating them into improvement loops, using live produc‐
tion data (e.g., user interactions, telemetry, and failure logs) to tighten the cycle:
feedback pipelines surface issues, experimentation validates fixes, and continuous
learning embeds them for immediate or ongoing impact.
In-Context Learning
In-context learning offers the most immediate and flexible means of adaptation in
foundation model-based systems. Rather than relying on model fine-tuning or archi‐
tectural changes, in-context learning empowers agents to modify their behavior
dynamically within a single session. By embedding examples, intermediate reasoning
steps, or contextual signals directly into prompts, agents can be "taught" new behav‐
iors on the fly-adapting at runtime rather than depending solely on static, pre‐
trained weights.
Consider an agent assisting users with code debugging. If the agent consistently
struggles with a particular type of error, an engineer can revise the prompt to include
an illustrative example that demonstrates the correct solution. This change takes
effect instantly, scoped only to the current session, enabling the agent to improve its
responses without requiring broader system retraining. Additionally, agents can lev‐
erage user feedback in real time-such as corrections or clarifications-to further
