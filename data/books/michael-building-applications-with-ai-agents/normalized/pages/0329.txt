• NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)
- A voluntary, risk‐based approach published by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) that spans four core functions: govern,
map, measure, and manage.
- Practitioners can download the AI RMF profiles and worksheets from NIST
to map their own system's risk levels, record mitigation strategies, and track
progress over time.
• Co‑designed AI Impact Assessment Template
- Developed with input from AI practitioners and compliance experts, this tem‐
plate aligns with the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and ISO 42001.
- It guides teams through documenting system purpose, stakeholder impacts,
bias and fairness checks, and mitigation plans-usable both pre‑deployment
and for ongoing governance.
Auditing plays a key role in maintaining accountability by offering structured assess‐
ments of agent behavior, system outputs, and decision pathways. Similarly, robust
logging and traceability mechanisms ensure that every action an agent takes can be
tracked, reviewed, and, if necessary, reversed or corrected.
Ethical audits are structured evaluations designed to identify ethical risks, unintended
consequences, and potential harm arising from agent behavior. These audits go
beyond technical testing to focus on the social, cultural, and organizational impacts
of agent systems. Fairness must be treated as a first-class audit objective, not an after‐
thought. Audits should include checks for disparate impacts across demographic
groups, feedback loops that might amplify bias, and the unintended consequences of
optimizing only for accuracy or efficiency. An effective ethical audit typically
involves:
Evaluation of outputs
Assessing whether an agent's actions align with its intended goals and ethical
guidelines
Bias and fairness checks
Identifying patterns of bias or unfair treatment in agent outputs
Decision pathway analysis
Reviewing how the agent arrives at its recommendations or decisions
Stakeholder impact assessments
Considering how the agent's behavior affects different user groups or
stakeholders
