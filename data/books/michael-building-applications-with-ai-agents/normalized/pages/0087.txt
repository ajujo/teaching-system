the interaction. In critical contexts, transparency is nonnegotiable, while in lowstakes settings, confidence can be presented more casually.
Asking for Guidance and Input from Users
No agent, no matter how advanced, can perfectly interpret ambiguous, vague, or con‐
flicting user inputs. Instead of making risky assumptions, agents must know when to
ask clarifying questions or seek user guidance. This ability transforms potential errors
into opportunities for collaboration.
Effective agents are designed to ask focused, helpful questions when they encounter
ambiguity. For example, if a user says "Book me a ticket to Chicago," the agent might
respond with "Would you like a one-way or round-trip ticket, and do you have pre‐
ferred travel dates?" Instead of defaulting to a generic response or making incorrect
assumptions, the agent uses the opportunity to refine its understanding.
The way agents ask for guidance also matters. Questions should be clear, polite, and
context-aware, avoiding robotic or repetitive phrasing. If the user has already
answered part of the question earlier in the conversation, the agent should reference
that context rather than starting from scratch.
Additionally, agents should be transparent about why they're asking for clarification.
A simple explanation, like "I need a bit more information to proceed accurately,"
helps users understand the rationale behind the question.
Finally, agents should avoid asking too many questions at once-this can overwhelm
users and make the interaction feel like an interrogation. Instead, they should
sequence questions logically, addressing the most critical ambiguities first.
When agents confidently ask for guidance and input, they transform uncertainty into
productive collaboration, empowering users to guide the agent toward successful out‐
comes while maintaining a sense of partnership and shared control.
Failing Gracefully
Failure is inevitable in agentic systems. Whether due to incomplete data, ambiguous
user input, technical limitations, or unexpected edge cases, agents will encounter sce‐
narios where they cannot fulfill a request or complete a task. However, how an agent
handles failure is just as important as how it handles success. A well-designed agent
doesn't just fail-it fails gracefully, minimizing user frustration, preserving trust, and
providing a clear path forward.
At its core, graceful failure involves acknowledging the issue transparently, offering a
helpful explanation, and suggesting actionable next steps. For instance, if an agent
cannot find an answer to a query, it might respond with "I couldn't find the
