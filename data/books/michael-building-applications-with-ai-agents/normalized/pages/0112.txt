Agent Types
Before diving into specific orchestration strategies, it's important to understand the
different types of agents you can build. Each agent type embodies a distinct approach
to reasoning, planning, and action, shaping how tasks are decomposed and executed.
Some agents respond instantly with preprogrammed mappings, while others itera‐
tively reason and reflect to handle complex, open-ended goals. The choice of agent
type directly influences your system's performance, cost, and capabilities. In this sec‐
tion, we will explore the spectrum: from reflex agents that provide lightning-fast
responses, to deep research agents that tackle multistage investigations with adaptive
plans and synthesis. Understanding these archetypes will help design agents aligned
with your application needs and constraints and will illuminate how orchestration
patterns, tool selection, and context construction come together within each type to
achieve effective, reliable outcomes.
Reflex Agents
Reflex agents implement a direct mapping from input to action without any internal
reasoning trace. Simple reflex agents follow "if-condition, then-action" rules, calling
the appropriate tool immediately upon detecting predefined triggers. Because they
bypass intermediate thought steps, reflex agents deliver responses with minimal
latency and predictable performance, making them well suited for use cases like
keyword-based routing, single-step data lookups, or basic automations (e.g., "If X,
call tool Y"). However, their limited expressiveness means they cannot handle tasks
requiring multistep reasoning or context beyond the immediate input.
ReAct Agents
ReAct agents interleave Reasoning and Action in an iterative loop: the model gener‐
ates a thought, selects and invokes a tool, observes the result, and repeats as needed.
This pattern enables the agent to break complex tasks into manageable steps, updat‐
ing its plan based on intermediate observations:
• ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION (LangChain) presents tools and instructions in a
single prompt, relying on the LLM's innate reasoning to select and call tools
without example traces.
• CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION extends this by incorporating conversa‐
tional history, enabling the agent to use past exchanges when deciding on its next
action.
ReAct agents excel in exploratory scenarios-dynamic data analysis, multisource
aggregation, or troubleshooting-where the ability to adapt midstream outweighs the
additional latency and computational overhead. Their looped structure also provides
