In Table 2-2, prices are shown as a multiple of the price per million tokens on Llama
3.1, which was the least expensive at the time of publishing. At the time of publishing,
Meta is charging $0.20 per million input tokens and $0.60 per million output tokens.
You might also notice that performance does not directly correlate to price. Also
know that performance on benchmarks offers useful guidance, but your mileage may
vary in how these benchmarks align with your particular task. When possible, com‐
pare the model for your task and find the model that provides you with the best price
per performance.
Ultimately, model selection is not a onetime decision but a strategic design choice
that must be revisited as agent capabilities, user needs, and infrastructure evolve.
Developers must weigh trade-offs between generality and specialization, performance
and cost, simplicity and extensibility. By carefully considering the task complexity,
input modalities, operational constraints, and customization needs, teams can choose
models that enable their agents to act efficiently, scale reliably, and perform with pre‐
cision in the real world.
Tools
In agent-based systems, tools are the fundamental capabilities that enable agents to
perform specific actions or solve problems. Tools represent the functional building
blocks of an agent, providing the ability to execute tasks and interact with both users
and other systems. An agent's effectiveness depends on the range and sophistication
of its tools.
Designing Capabilities for Specific Tasks
Tools are typically tailored to the tasks that the agent is designed to solve. When
designing tools, developers must consider how the agent will perform under different
conditions and contexts. A well-designed toolset ensures that the agent can handle a
variety of tasks with precision and efficiency. Tools can be divided into three main
categories:
Local tools
These are actions that the agent performs based on internal logic and computa‐
tions without external dependencies. Local tools are often rule-based or involve
executing predefined functions. Examples include mathematical calculations,
data retrieval from local databases, or simple decision making based on
