I would like to thank Luke Miratrix, who introduced me to statistics and taught me
how to code. I would also like to thank my core academic mentors Lisa Schmitt, Lise
Shelton, James Sheehan, Finbarr Livesey, Matthew Sommer, James Ward, Charles
Isbell, Michael Littman, Zsolt Kira, and Constantine Dovrolis for shaping my think‐
ing in ways big and small.
This book is, in many ways, a distillation of lessons I've learned throughout my life
and career, and I am grateful to many more people than I can name here. I am deeply
grateful to have the opportunity to release this book out into the world, and I truly
hope it serves you well.
