organizational infrastructure-is essential for designing effective collaboration mod‐
els, access controls, and governance structures.
At the smallest scope, agents serve individuals: helping manage calendars, summarize
emails, or provide research support. These agents benefit from intimate context but
have limited authority and minimal risk. Their success depends on understanding the
preferences and working styles of a single user. Over time, individuals often delegate
more responsibility to these agents, but oversight remains straightforward.
Team agents represent the next layer of complexity. They assist with shared knowl‐
edge management, project tracking, or meeting synthesis. These agents must navigate
shared memory boundaries, respect interpersonal dynamics, and mediate across
potentially conflicting expectations. They require more sophisticated context man‐
agement and must surface uncertainties that might require group decision making
rather than unilateral action.
We see this in Bank of America's "Erica" assistant, which today handles over two bil‐
lion customer requests and more than half of internal IT-help-desk tickets; by surfac‐
ing its confidence (e.g., "I'm 85% sure this answers your question") and providing a
clear handoff to a live agent whenever uncertainty rose above a defined threshold,
Erica scaled from simple FAQs to trusted enterprise-wide service.
As we scale to division- or function-level agents-such as agents supporting finance,
legal, or customer success-responsibilities expand dramatically. These agents inter‐
act with sensitive systems, touch multiple stakeholders, and influence performance at
scale.
At this level, role-based access control (RBAC) becomes crucial. Agents must differ‐
entiate between public, internal, and restricted knowledge. They should have different
privileges when acting on behalf of a VP than when assisting an intern. Clear delega‐
tion frameworks and logging are essential to ensure accountability.
At the highest level, enterprise-wide agents may coordinate workflows across depart‐
ments, synthesize cross-functional data, or even advise on strategic decisions. These
agents must operate within strong governance boundaries, subject to strict policies,
regular audits, and often human sign-off for critical actions. They must be aware of
inter-team dependencies, business rules, and organizational politics.
Critically, the design of these agents is not just a technical challenge-it's a sociotech‐
nical one. Agents must align with organizational culture, incentives, and workflows.
Collaboration interfaces must make it easy for humans to review, approve, or modify
agent outputs. Escalation pathways must scale with responsibility. And as agents span
wider scopes, the cost of errors-and the need for well-defined trust boundariesincreases.
