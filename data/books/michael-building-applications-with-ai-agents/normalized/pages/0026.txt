Conversational agents
This category includes chatbots and customer service agents that engage users
through natural language interfaces. They are optimized for dialogue manage‐
ment, intent recognition, and conversational turn-taking, such as virtual assis‐
tants embedded in customer support platforms.
Research agents
Research agents conduct information gathering, synthesis, and summarization
tasks. They scan documents, knowledge bases, or the web to provide structured
outputs that assist human analysts. Examples include Perplexity AI and Elicit.
Analytics agents
Analytics agents, such as Power BI Copilot or Glean, focus on interpreting struc‐
tured datasets and generating insights, dashboards, and reports. They often inte‐
grate tightly with enterprise data warehouses, enabling users to query complex
data in natural language.
Developer agents
Tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot represent coding agents, which
assist developers by generating, refactoring, and explaining code. They integrate
deeply into IDE workflows to augment software development productivity.
Domain-specific agents
These agents are tuned for specialized professional domains, such as legal (Har‐
vey), medical (Hippocratic AI), or finance agents. They combine domain-specific
knowledge with structured workflows to deliver targeted, expert-level assistance.
Browser-using agents
These agents navigate, interact with, extract information from, and take actions
on websites without human interaction. As opposed to traditional robotic pro‐
cess automation, which follows prescripted steps, modern browser-using agents
combine language understanding, visual perception, and dynamic planning to
adapt on the fly.
In addition to these seven types of agents, voice and video agents are important and
also expected to increase in adoption in the coming years:
Voice agents
Powered by end-to-end speech understanding and generation, these agents are
enabling conversational automation in areas like customer service, appointment
scheduling, and even real-time order processing.
Video agents
These agents present users with avatar-based video responses, combining lipsynced speech, facial expression, and gesture. They're emerging rapidly in sales,
