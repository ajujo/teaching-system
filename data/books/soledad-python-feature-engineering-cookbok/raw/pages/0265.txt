Creating New Features

from sklearn import set_config
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

Let’s set scikit-learn library’s set_output API globally so that all transformers return 
a DataFrame as a result of the transform() method:
set_config(transform_output="pandas")
3.	
Let’s create a DataFrame containing one variable, with values from 1 to 10:
df = pd.DataFrame(np.linspace(
    0, 10, 11), columns=["var"])
4.	
Let’s set up PolynomialFeatures() to create all possible combinations up to a third-
degree polynomial of the single variable and exclude the bias term from the result – that is, 
we will exclude the value 1:
poly = PolynomialFeatures(
    degree=3,
    interaction_only=False,
    include_bias=False)
5.	
Now, let’s create the polynomial combinations:
dft = poly.fit_transform(df)
If we execute dft, we’ll see a DataFrame with the original feature, followed by its values squared, 
and then its values to the power of three:
