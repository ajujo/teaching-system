Extracting Features from Relational Data with Featuretools

Figure 9.5 – Relationships between the tables containing invoices, customers, and products
Af﻿tter entering the data and their relationships, we can start automatically creating features 
for each one of our new DataFrames – that is, customers, invoices, and products – using the 
default parameters from featuretools.
12.	 Let’s create features by aggregating the data at the customer level. To do this, we set up the deep 
feature synthesis (dfs) class from featuretools, indicating customers as the target 
DataFrame. When creating features, we want to ignore the two columns with unique identifiers:
feature_matrix, feature_defs = ft.dfs(
    entityset=es,
    target_dataframe_name=»customers»,
    ignore_columns={
        «invoices»:[«invoice»],
        «invoices»:[«customer_id»],
    }
)
