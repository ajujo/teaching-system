Visualizing outliers with boxplots and the inter-quartile proximity rule
155
How to do it...
We will create boxplots utilizing the seaborn library. Let’s begin by importing the Python libraries 
and loading the dataset:
1.	
Let’s import the Python libraries and the dataset:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
2.	
Modify the default background from seaborn (it makes prettier plots, but that’s subjective, 
of course):
sns.set(style="darkgrid")
3.	
Load the California house prices dataset from scikit-learn:
X, y = fetch_california_housing(
    return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
4.	
Make a boxplot of the MedInc variable to visualize its distribution:
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 3))
sns.boxplot(data=X["MedInc"], orient="y")
plt.title("Boxplot")
plt.show()
In the following boxplot, we identify the box containing the observations within the IQR, that is, the 
observations between the first and third quartiles. We also see the whiskers. On the left, the whisker 
extends to the minimum value of MedInc; on the right, the whisker goes up to the third quartile plus 
1.5 times the IQR. Values beyond the right whisker are represented as dots and could constitute outliers:

outliers on the right tail of the distribution
