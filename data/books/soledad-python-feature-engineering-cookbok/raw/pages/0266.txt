Performing polynomial expansion
243
If, instead of returning a DataFrame, PolynomialFeatures() returns a NumPy array 
and you want to obtain the names of the features in the array, you can do so by executing 
poly.get_feature_names_out(), which returns array(['var', 'var^2', 
'var^3'], dtype=object).

Now, let’s plot the new feature values against the original variable:
dft = pd.DataFrame(
    dft, columns=poly.get_feature_names_out())
plt.plot(df["var"], dft)
plt.legend(dft.columns)
plt.xlabel("original variable")
plt.ylabel("new variables")
plt.show()
In the following diagram, we can see the relationship between the polynomial features and 
the original variable:

polynomial expansion and the original variable

Let’s add two additional variables to our toy dataset, with values from 1 to 10:
df["col"] = np.linspace(0, 5, 11)
df["feat"] = np.linspace(0, 5, 11)
