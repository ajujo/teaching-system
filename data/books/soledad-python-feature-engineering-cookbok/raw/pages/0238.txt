Performing mean normalization
215
Note
Mean normalization is an alternative to standardization. In both cases, the variables are centered 
at 0. In mean normalization, the variance varies, while the values lie between -1 and 1. On the 
other hand, in standardization, the variance is set to 1 and the value range varies.
Mean normalization is a suitable alternative for models that need the variables to be centered at 
zero. However, it is sensitive to outliers and not a suitable option for sparse data, as it will destroy the 
sparse nature.
How to do it...
In this recipe, we will implement mean normalization with pandas:
1.	
Let’s import pandas and the required scikit-learn class and function:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
2.	
Let’s load the California housing dataset from scikit-learn into a pandas DataFrame, dropping 
the Latitude and Longitude variables:
X, y = fetch_california_housing(
    return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
X.drop(labels=[
   "Latitude", "Longitude"], axis=1, inplace=True)
3.	
Let’s divide the data into train and test sets:
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)
4.	
Let’s learn the mean values from the variables in the train set:
means = X_train.mean(axis=0)
Note
We set axis=0 to take the mean of the rows – that is, of the observations in each variable. If we 
set axis=1 instead, pandas will calculate the mean value per observation across all the columns.
