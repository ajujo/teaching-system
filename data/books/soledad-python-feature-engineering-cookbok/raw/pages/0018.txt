Preface

Chapter 11, Extracting Features from Text Variables, explores effective methods to clean and extract 
features from short text segments for use in supervised learning models. The chapter covers techniques 
to count words, sentences, and characters and measure lexical diversity. Additionally, it guides you 
through text cleaning processes and demonstrates how to build feature matrices by counting words.
To get the most out of this book
This book provides practical tools and techniques to streamline your feature engineering pipelines, 
allowing you to enhance code quality and simplify processes. The book explores methods to transform 
and create features to effectively train machine learning models with Python. Therefore, familiarity 
with machine learning and Python programming will benefit your understanding and application of 
the concepts presented.

Software/hardware covered in the book
OS requirements
Python 3.9 or greater
Windows, macOS, or Linux
Note that earlier or newer versions of the Python libraries may prevent code from running. If you are 
using newer versions, make sure to check their documentation for any recent updates, parameter name 
changes, or deprecation.
If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access 
the code via the GitHub repository (the link is available in the next section). Doing so will help 
you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.
