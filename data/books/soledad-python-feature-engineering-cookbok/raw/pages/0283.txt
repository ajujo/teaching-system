Let’s get a sense of what splines are. In the following figure, on the left, we can see a spline with a degree of 
1. It consists of two linear pieces – one from 2.5 to 5 and the other from 5 to 7.5. There are three knots – 2.5, 
5, and 7.5. Outside the interval between 2.5 and 7.5, the spline takes a value of 0. The latter is characteristic 
of splines; they are only non-negative between certain values. On the right panel of the figure, we can see 
three splines of degree 1. We can construct as many splines as we want by introducing more knots:
Figure 8.18 – The splines with a degree of 1
In the following figure, on the left, we can see a quadratic spline, also known as a spline with a degree 
of 2. It is based on four adjacent knots – 0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5. On the right-hand side of the figure, we 
can see several splines of degree 2:
Figure 8.19 – The splines with a degree of 2
We can use splines to model non-linear functions, and we will learn how to do this in the next section.
