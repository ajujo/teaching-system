If you want to use DropMissingData() within a pipeline together with other Feature-engine or 
scikit-learn transformers, check out Feature-engine’s Pipeline: https://Feature-engine.

can align the target with the training  and test sets after removing rows.
Performing mean or median imputation
Mean or median imputation consists of replacing missing data with the variable’s mean or median 
value. To avoid data leakage, we determine the mean or median using the train set, and then use these 
values to impute the train and test sets, and all future data.
Scikit-learn and Feature-engine learn the mean or median from the train set and store these parameters 
for future use out of the box.
In this recipe, we will perform mean and median imputation using pandas, scikit-learn, 
and feature-engine.
Note
Use mean imputation if variables are normally distributed and median imputation otherwise. 
Mean and median imputation may distort the variable distribution if there is a high percentage 
of missing data.
How to do it...
Let’s begin this recipe:
1.	
First, we’ll import pandas and the required functions and classes from scikit-learn 
and feature-engine:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from feature_engine.imputation import MeanMedianImputer
2.	
Let’s load the dataset that we prepared in the Technical requirements section:
data = pd.read_csv("credit_approval_uci.csv")
