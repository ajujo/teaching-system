In the following output, we see the variable that captures the time difference between the two 
datetime variables in days:

Working with time in different time zones
Some organizations operate internationally; therefore, the information they collect about events may 
be recorded alongside the time zone of the area where the event took place. To be able to compare 
events that occurred across different time zones, we typically have to set all of the variables within 
the same zone. In this recipe, we will learn how to unify the time zones of a datetime variable and 
how to reassign a variable to a different time zone using pandas.
How to do it...
To proceed with this recipe, we’ll create a sample DataFrame containing two variables in different 
time zones:
1.	
Let’s import pandas:
import pandas as pd
2.	
Let’s create a DataFrame containing one variable with values in different time zones:
df = pd.DataFrame()
df['time1'] = pd.concat([
    pd.Series(
