Encoding Categorical Variables
82
We can display the top rows of the transformed train set by executing print(X_train_enc.
head()), which returns the following output:
Figure 2.11 – DataFrame with the variables after binary encoding
Binary encoding returned four binary variables for A7, which are A7_0, A7_1, A7_2, and 
A7_3, instead of the nine that would have been returned by one-hot encoding.
How it works...
In this recipe, we performed binary encoding using the Category Encoders package. We used 
BinaryEncoder() to encode the A7 variable. With the fit() method, BinaryEncoder() 
created a mapping from a category to a set of binary columns, and with the transform() method, 
the encoder encoded the A7 variable in both the train and test sets.
