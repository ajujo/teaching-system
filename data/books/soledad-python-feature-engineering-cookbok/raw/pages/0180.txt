Visualizing outliers with boxplots and the inter-quartile proximity rule
157
Now that we’ve seen how we can visualize outliers, let’s see how to calculate the limits beyond 
which we find outliers at each side of the distribution.
7.	
Let’s create a function that returns the limits based on the IQR proximity rule:
def find_limits(df, variable, fold):
    q1 = df[variable].quantile(0.25)
    q3 = df[variable].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = q3 - q1
    lower_limit = q1 - (IQR * fold)
    upper_limit = q3 + (IQR * fold)
    return lower_limit, upper_limit
Note
Remember that the first and third quartiles are equivalent to the 25th and 75th percentiles. 
That’s why we use pandas’ quantile to determine those values.
8.	
With the function from step 7, we’ll calculate the extreme limits for MedInc:
lower_limit, upper_limit = find_limits(
    X, "MedInc", 1.5)
If we now execute lower_limit and upper_limit, we will see the values -0.7063 
and 8.013. The lower limit is beyond MedInc’s minimum value, hence in the boxplot, the 
whisker only goes up to the minimum value. The upper limit, on the other hand, coincides 
with the right whisker’s limit.
Note
Common values to multiply the IQR are 1.5, which is the default value in boxplots, or 3 if 
we want to be more conservative.
9.	
Let’s display the box plot and histogram for the HouseAge variable:
plot_boxplot_and_hist(X, "HouseAge")
We can see that this variable does not seem to contain outliers, and hence the whiskers in the 
box plot extend to the minimum and maximum values:
