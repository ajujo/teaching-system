Using power transformations
101
5.	
Let’s capture the variables to transform in a list:
variables = ["MedInc", "Population"]
6.	
Let’s make a copy of the DataFrame and then apply a power transformation to the variables 
from step 5, where the exponent is 0.3:
X_tf = X.copy()
X_tf[variables] = np.power(X[variables], 0.3)
Note
With np.power(), we can apply any power transformation by changing the value of the 
exponent in the second position of the function.
7.	
Let’s examine the change in the distribution of Population:
diagnostic_plots(X_tf, "Population")
As shown in the plots returned by the previous command, Population is now more evenly 
distributed across the value range and follows the quantiles of the normal distribution more closely:
Figure 3.9 – A histogram and Q-Q plot of the Population variable after the transformation
Now, let’s apply a power transformation with scikit-learn.
8.	
Let’s set up FunctionTransformer() with a power transformation with an exponent of 0.3:
transformer = FunctionTransformer(
    lambda x: np.power(x,0.3))
