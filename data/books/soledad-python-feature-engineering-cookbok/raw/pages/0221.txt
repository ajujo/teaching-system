Extracting Features from Date and Time Variables

In this recipe, we will automatically create features from date and time by utilizing feature-engine.
How to do it...
To showcase feature-engine’s functionality, we’ll create a sample DataFrame with a 
datetime variable:
1.	
Let’s begin by importing pandas and DatetimeFeatures():
import pandas as pd
from feature_engine.datetime import DatetimeFeatures
2.	
Let’s create a datetime variable with 20 values, beginning from 2024-05-17 at midnight 
and followed by increments of 1 day. Then, we store this variable in a DataFrame:
rng_ = pd.date_range(
    '2024-05-17', periods=20, freq='D')
data = pd.DataFrame({'date': rng_})
3.	
We’ll start by setting up the transformer to extract all supported datetime features:
dtfs = DatetimeFeatures(
    variables=None,
    features_to_extract= "all",
)
Note
DatetimeFeatures() automatically finds the variables of the datetime type, or that 
could be parsed as datetime when the variables parameter is set to None. Alternatively, 
you can pass a list with the names of the variables from which you want to extract date and 
time features.
4.	
Let’s add the date and time features to the data:
dft = dtfs.fit_transform(data)
Note
By default, DatetimeFeatures() extracts the following features from each datetime 
variable: month, year, day_of_week, day_of_month, hour, minute, and second. 
We can modify this behavior through the features_to_extract parameter as we did 
in Step 3.
