Discretizing the variable into arbitrary intervals
131
In this recipe, we will discretize a variable into pre-defined user intervals using pandas and feature-
engine.
How to do it...
First, let’s import the necessary Python libraries and get the dataset ready:
1.	
Import Python libraries and classes:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
2.	
Let’s load the California housing dataset into a pandas DataFrame:
X, y = fetch_california_housing(
    return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
3.	
Let’s plot a histogram of the Population variable to find out its value range:
X["Population"].hist(bins=30)
plt.title("Population")
plt.ylabel("Number of observations")
plt.show()
Population values vary between 0 and approximately 40,000:
