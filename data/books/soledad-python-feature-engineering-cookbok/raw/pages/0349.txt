Creating Features from a Time Series with tsfresh
326
Figure 10.7 – DataFrame with the features created for each hour of light consumption
Now, we will use these features to train a logistic regression model to predict whether the office 
was occupied.

Let’s begin by separating the dataset into training and test sets:
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    features,
    y,
    test_size=0.1,
    random_state=42,
)
7.	
Now, let’s set up and train a logistic regression model, and then evaluate its performance:
cls = LogisticRegression(random_state=10, C=0.01)
cls.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(classification_report(
    y_test, cls.predict(X_test)))
In the following output, we see the evaluation metrics that are commonly used for classification 
analysis. These suggest that the selected features are useful for predicting office occupancy:
                    precision     recall  f1-score   support
               0         1.00        0.91        0.95
