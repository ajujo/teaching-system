Performing Box-Cox transformations

11.	 Now, let’s return Q-Q plots of the transformed variables:
make_qqplot(X_tf)
In the following output, we can see that, after the transformation, the variables follow the 
theoretical normal distribution more closely:

Now, let’s implement the Box-Cox transformation with Feature-engine.
12.	 Let’s set up BoxCoxTransformer() to transform all the variables in the dataset and then 
fit it to the data:
bct = BoxCoxTransformer()
bct.fit(X)
13.	 Now, let’s go ahead and transform the variables:
X_tf = bct.transform(X)
The transformation returns a pandas DataFrame containing the modified variables.
