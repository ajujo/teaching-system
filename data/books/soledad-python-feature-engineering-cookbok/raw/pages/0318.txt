Extracting features from text

In the following output, we see the DataFrame with the new features:
Figure 9.10 – DataFrame with some of the features derived from datetime
Note that some of the created features are numeric, such as HOUR or DAY, some are Booleans, such 
as IS_FEDERAL_HOLIDAY, and some are categorical, such as PART_OF_DAY. To take a look at 
the values of PART_OF_DAY, execute feature_matrix["PART_OF_DAY(first_data_
time)"].unique().
How it works...
To create features from datetime variables, we used datetime transform primitives from featuretools 
(https://featuretools.alteryx.com/en/stable/api_reference.html#datetime-
transform-primitives). These primitives can be accessed from dfs using the strings and 
functions we specified in steps 6 to 9 through the trans_primitive parameter. Note that in 
addition, we passed an empty list to the agg_primitives parameter not to return the default 
aggregation primitives that would have been otherwise applied to our datetime features. We also 
ignored the features coming from the invoices DataFrame.
Note
We set agg_primitives to an empty list and ignored the invoices DataFrame to keep 
the outputs simple and be able to focus on datetime features. However, note that the real power 
of featuretools consists in creating primitives from datetime and then aggregating 
them further at different entity levels.
Extracting features from text
In Chapter 11, Extracting Features from Text Variables, we will discuss various features that we can 
extract from text pieces utilizing pandas and scikit-learn. We can also extract multiple features 
from text automatically by utilizing featuretools.
The featuretools library supports the creation of several basic features from text as part of its 
default functionality, such as the number of characters, the number of words, the mean character 
count per word, and the median word length in a piece of text, among others.
