Creating binary variables through one-hot encoding

Figure 2.3 – Arrays with the categories that will be encoded into binary variables (one array per variable)
Note
scikit-learn’s OneHotEncoder() will only encode the categories learned from the 
train set. If there are new categories in the test set, we can instruct the encoder to ignore them, 
return an error, or replace them with an infrequent category, by setting the handle_unknown 
parameter to ignore, error, or infrequent_if_exists.
14.	 Let’s encode the categorical variables:
X_train_enc = ct.transform(X_train)
X_test_enc = ct.transform(X_test)
Make sure to inspect the result by executing X_test_enc.head().
15.	 To get familiar with the output, let’s print the variable names of the resulting DataFrame:
ct.get_feature_names_out()
In the following image, we see the names of the variables in the transformed DataFrame:
