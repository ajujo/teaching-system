Performing Feature Scaling

Let’s now print the descriptive statistical values from the transformed variables:
X_test_scaled.describe()
In the following output, we see that the variables’ mean is now centered at 0 and the variance 
is approximately 1:
Figure 7.3 – Descriptive statistical parameters of the scaled variables 
showing a mean of 0 and variance of approximately 1
Note
The AveRooms, AveBedrms, and AveOccup variables are highly skewed, which can lead 
to observed values in the test set that are much greater or much smaller than those in the 
training set, and hence we see that the variance deviates from 1. This is to be expected because 
standardization is sensitive to outliers and very skewed distributions.
We mentioned, in the Getting ready section, that the shape of the distribution does not change with 
standardization. Go ahead and corroborate that by executing  X_test.hist() and then X_test_
scaled.hist() to compare the variables’ distribution before and after the transformation.
How it works...
In this recipe, we standardized the variables of the California housing dataset by utilizing scikit-
learn. We split the data into train and test sets because the parameters for the standardization should 
be learned from the train set. This is to avoid leaking data from the test to the train set during the 
preprocessing steps and to ensure the test set remains naïve to all feature transformation processes.
