Finding outliers using the mean and standard deviation
In normally distributed variables, around 99.8% of the observations lie within the interval comprising 
the mean plus and minus three times the standard deviation. Thus, values beyond those limits can 
be considered outliers; they are rare.
Note
Using the mean and standard deviation to detect outliers has some drawbacks. Firstly, it assumes 
a normal distribution, including outliers. Secondly, outliers strongly influence the mean and 
standard deviation. Therefore, a recommended alternative is the Median Absolute Deviation 
(MAD), which we’ll discuss in the next recipe.
In this recipe, we will identify outliers as those observations that lie outside the interval delimited by 
the mean plus and minus three times the standard deviation.
How to do it...
Let’s begin the recipe by importing the Python libraries and loading the dataset:
1.	
Let’s import the Python libraries and dataset:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
2.	
Load the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn:
X, y = load_breast_cancer(
    return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
3.	
Create a function to plot a boxplot next to a histogram:
def plot_boxplot_and_hist(data, variable):
    f, (ax_box, ax_hist) = plt.subplots(
        2, sharex=True,
        gridspec_kw={"height_ratios": (0.50, 0.85)})
    sns.boxplot(x=data[variable], ax=ax_box)
    sns.histplot(data=data, x=variable, ax=ax_hist)
    plt.show()
Note
We discussed the function from step 3 in the previous recipe, Visualizing outliers with boxplots 
and the inter-quartile proximity rule.
