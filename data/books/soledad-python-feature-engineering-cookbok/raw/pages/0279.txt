Creating New Features

Now, make a scatter plot between the hour and its cosine transformation:
plt.scatter(df["hour"], df["hour_cos"])
plt.ylabel("Cosine of hour")
plt.xlabel("Hour")
plt.title("Cosine transformation")
In the following plot, we can see how the values of the hour circle between -1 and 1, just like 
the cosine function after the transformation:
Figure 8.14 – A scatter plot of the hour versus its cosine-transformed values
Finally, we can reconstitute the cyclical nature of the hour, which is now captured by the two 
new features.

Plot the values of the sine versus the cosine of the hour, and overlay the original values of the 
hour using a color map:
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 5))
sp = ax.scatter(
    df["hour_sin"], df["hour_cos"], c=df["hour"])
ax.set(
    xlabel="sin(hour)",
    ylabel="cos(hour)",
)
_ = fig.colorbar(sp)
