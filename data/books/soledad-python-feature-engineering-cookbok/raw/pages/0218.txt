Working with time in different time zones
195
Note
The time zone is indicated with the +02 and -05 values, respectively, which indicates the time 
difference to the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

To work with different time zones, we typically set the variables in the same time zone, in this 
case, we chose the UTC:
df['time1_utc'] = pd.to_datetime(
    df['time1'], utc=True)
df['time2_utc'] = pd.to_datetime(
    df['time2'], utc=True)
If we now execute df, we’ll see the new variables, which have a difference of 00 hours with respect 
to UTC:

Let’s calculate the difference in days between the variables and then display the first five rows 
of the DataFrame:
df['elapsed_days'] = (
    df[‹time2_utc›] - df[‹time1_utc›]). dt.days
df['elapsed_days'].head()
We see the time difference between the variables in the following output:
0    21
1    21
2    21
0   -40
1   -40
Name: elapsed_days, dtype: int64
