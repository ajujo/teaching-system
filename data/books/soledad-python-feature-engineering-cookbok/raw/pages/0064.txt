Estimating missing data with nearest neighbors
41
5.	
Find the nearest neighbors:
imputer.fit(X_train)
6.	
Replace the missing values with the weighted mean of the values shown by the neighbors:
X_train_t = imputer.transform(X_train)
X_test_t = imputer.transform(X_test)
The result is a pandas DataFrame with the missing data replaced.
How it works...
In this recipe, we replaced missing data with the average value shown by each observation’s k-nearest 
neighbors. We set up KNNImputer() to find each observation’s five closest neighbors based on 
the Euclidean distance. The replacement values were estimated as the weighted average of the values 
shown by the five closest neighbors for the variable to impute. With transform(), the imputer 
calculated the replacement value and replaced the missing data.
