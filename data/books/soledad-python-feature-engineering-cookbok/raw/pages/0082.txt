Replacing categories with counts or the frequency of observations
59
The previous attribute stores the mappings that will be used to replace the categories:
Figure 2.7 – Dictionary containing the number of observations per category, for 
each variable; these values will be used to encode the categorical variables
9.	
Finally, let’s with counts or frequency of observations” replace the categories with counts in 
the train and test sets:
X_train_enc = count_enc.transform(X_train)
X_test_enc = count_enc.transform(X_test)
Check out the result by executing X_train_enc.head(). The encoder returns pandas DataFrames 
with the strings of the categorical variables replaced with the counts of observations, leaving the 
variables ready to use in machine learning models.
