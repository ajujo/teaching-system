Removing observations with missing data
5
5.	
Now, we’ll remove observations if they have missing values in any variable:
train_cca = X_train.dropna()
test_cca = X_test.dropna()
Note
pandas’ dropna()drops observations with any missing value by default. We can remove 
observations with missing data in a subset of variables like this: data.dropna(subset=["A3", 
"A4"]).
6.	
Let’s print and compare the size of the original and complete case datasets:
print(f"Total observations: {len(X_train)}")
print(f"Observations without NAN: {len(train_cca)}")
We removed more than 200 observations with missing data from the training set, as shown 
in the following output:
Total observations: 483
Observations without NAN: 264
7.	
After removing observations from the training and test sets, we need to align the target variables:
y_train_cca = y_train.loc[train_cca.index]
y_test_cca = y_test.loc[test_cca.index]
Now, the datasets and target variables contain the rows without missing data.
8.	
To drop observations with missing data utilizing feature-engine, let’s import the 
required transformer:
from feature_engine.imputation import DropMissingData
9.	
Let’s set up the imputer to automatically find the variables with missing data:
cca = DropMissingData(variables=None, missing_only=True)
10.	 Let’s fit the transformer so that it finds the variables with missing data:
cca.fit(X_train)
11.	 Let’s inspect the variables with NAN that the transformer found:
cca.variables_
The previous command returns the names of the variables with missing data:
['A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4', 'A5', 'A6', 'A7', 'A8', 'A9', 'A10', 
'A14']
