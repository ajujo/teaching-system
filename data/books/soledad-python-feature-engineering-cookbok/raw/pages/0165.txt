Performing Variable Discretization
142
In the following histograms, we can see that the different words appear zero times in 
most documents:

Let’s set up binarizer to clip all values greater than 1 to 1 and return DataFrames as a result:
binarizer = Binarizer(threshold = 0) .set_
output(transform="pandas")
5.	
Let’s binarize the variables:
data_t = binarizer.fit_transform(data)
Now we can explore the distribution of the binarized variables by displaying the histograms as 
in step 3, or better, by creating bar plots.
