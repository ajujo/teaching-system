Performing ordinal encoding based on the target value

Figure 2.8 – Mean target value per category of A7 before the encoding

Let’s plot the mean target value per category in the encoded variable:
y_train.groupby(X_train_enc["A7"]).mean().plot()
plt.title("Relationship between A7 and the target")
plt.ylabel("Mean of target")
plt.show()
The encoded variable shows a monotonic relationship with the target – the higher the mean 
target value, the higher the digit assigned to the category:
Figure 2.9 – Mean target value per category of A7 after the encoding.
Now, let’s perform ordered ordinal encoding using feature-engine.
