Note
ArbitraryNumberImputer() will automatically select all numerical variables in the 
train set for imputation if we set the variables parameter to None.

Finally, let’s replace the missing values with 99:
X_train = imputer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = imputer.transform(X_test)
Note
To impute different variables with different numbers, set up ArbitraryNumberImputer() 
as follows: ArbitraryNumberImputer(imputater_dict = {"A2": -1, "A3": 
-1, "A8": 999, "A11": 9999}).
We have now replaced missing data with arbitrary numbers using three different open-source libraries.
How it works...
In this recipe, we replaced missing values in numerical variables with an arbitrary number using 
pandas, scikit-learn, and feature-engine.
To determine which arbitrary value to use, we inspected the maximum values of four numerical 
variables using pandas’ max(). We chose 99 because it was greater than the maximum values of the 
selected variables. In step 5, we used pandas fillna() to replace the missing data.
To replace missing values using scikit-learn, we utilized SimpleImputer(), with the 
strategy set to constant, and specified 99 in the fill_value argument. Next, we fitted the 
imputer to a slice of the train set with the numerical variables to impute. Finally, we replaced missing 
values using transform().
To replace missing values with feature-engine we used ArbitraryValueImputer(), 
specifying the value 99 and the variables to impute as parameters. Next, we applied the fit_
transform() method to replace missing data in the train set and the transform() method to 
replace missing data in the test set.
Finding extreme values for imputation
Replacing missing values with a value at the end of the variable distribution (extreme values) is like 
replacing them with an arbitrary value, but instead of setting the arbitrary values manually, the values 
are automatically selected from the end of the variable distribution.
