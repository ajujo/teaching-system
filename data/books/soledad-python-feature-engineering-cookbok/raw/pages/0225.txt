Extracting Features from Date and Time Variables
202
With fit(), DatetimeFeatures() does not learn any parameters; instead, it checks that the 
variables entered by the user are, or can be, parsed into a datetime format. If the user does not 
indicate variable names, DatetimeFeatures() finds the datetime variables automatically. 
With transform(), the transformer adds the date and time-derived variables to the DataFrame.
