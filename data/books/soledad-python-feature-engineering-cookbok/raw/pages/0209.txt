Extracting Features from Date and Time Variables
186
3.	
Let’s extract the hour, minute, and second part and capture them into three new columns, 
then display the DataFrame’s top five rows:
df["hour"] = df["date"].dt.hour
df["min"] = df["date"].dt.minute
df["sec"] = df["date"].dt.second
df.head()
In the following output, we see the three time features that we extracted in Step 3:

Note
Remember that pandas’ dt needs a datetime object to work. You can change the data type 
of an object variable into datetime by using pandas to_datetime().

Let’s perform the same operations that we did in Step 3 but now in one line of code:
df[["h", "m", "s"]] = pd.DataFrame(
    [(x.hour, x.minute, x.second) for x in df["date"]]
)
df.head()
We see the newly created variables in the following output:
