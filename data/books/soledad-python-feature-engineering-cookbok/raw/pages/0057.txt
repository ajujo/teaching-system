Imputing Missing Data
34
Note
Change the degree of the polynomial used in the interpolation to see how the replacement 
values vary.
We’ve now obtained complete datasets that we can use for analysis and modeling.
How it works...
pandas interpolate() fills missing values in a range by using an interpolation method. When 
we set the method to linear, interpolate() treats all data points as equidistant and fits a line 
between the last and next valid points in an interval with missing data.
Note
If you want to perform linear interpolation, but your data points are not equally distanced, set 
method to time.
We then performed spline interpolation with a second-degree polynomial by setting method to 
spline and order to 2.
pandas interpolate() uses scipy.interpolate.interp1d and scipy.interpolate.
UnivariateSpline under the hood, and can therefore implement other interpolation methods.

While interpolation aims to get better estimates of the missing data compared to forward and backward 
fill, these estimates may still not be accurate if the times series show strong trend and seasonality. 
To obtain better estimates of the missing data in these types of time series, check out time series 
decomposition followed by interpolation in the Feature Engineering for Time Series Course at https://

Performing multivariate imputation by chained equations
Multivariate imputation methods, as opposed to univariate imputation, use multiple variables to 
estimate the missing values. Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) models each 
variable with missing values as a function of the remaining variables in the dataset. The output of that 
function is used to replace missing data.
