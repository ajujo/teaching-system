Implementing maximum absolute scaling
223
How it works...
In this recipe, we scaled the sparse variables of a bag of words to their absolute maximum values by 
using MaxAbsScaler(). With fit(), the scaler learned the maximum absolute values for each 
variable and stored them in its max_abs_ attribute. With transform(), the scaler divided the 
variables by their absolute maximum values, returning a pandas DataFrame.
Note
Remember that you can change the output container to a NumPy array or a polars DataFrame 
through the set_output() method of the scikit-learn library’s transformers.
There’s more...
If you want to center the variables’ distribution at 0 and then scale them to their absolute maximum, 
you can do so by combining the use of two scikit-learn transformers within a pipeline:
1.	
Let’s import the required libraries, transformers, and functions:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import (
    MaxAbsScaler, StandardScaler)
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
2.	
Let’s load the California housing dataset and split it into train and test sets:
X, y = fetch_california_housing(
    return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
X.drop( labels=[ "Latitude",
    "Longitude"], axis=1, inplace=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)
3.	
Let’s set up StandardScaler() from scikit-learn so that it learns and subtracts the mean 
but does not divide the result by the standard deviation:
scaler_mean = StandardScaler(
    with_mean=True, with_std=False)
4.	
Now, let’s set up MaxAbsScaler() with its default parameters:
scaler_maxabs = MaxAbsScaler()
