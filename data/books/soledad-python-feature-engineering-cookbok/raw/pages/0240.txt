Performing mean normalization
217
How it works…
To implement mean normalization, we captured the mean values of the numerical variables in the 
train set using mean() from pandas. Next, we determined the difference between the maximum 
and minimum values of the numerical variables in the train set by utilizing max() and min() 
from pandas. Finally, we used the pandas series returned by these functions containing the mean 
values and the value ranges to normalize the train and test sets. We subtracted the mean from each 
observation in our train and test sets and divided the result by the value ranges. This returned the 
normalized variables in a pandas DataFrame.
There’s more...
There is no dedicated scikit-learn transformer to implement mean normalization, but we can combine 
the use of two transformers to do so.
To do this, we need to import pandas and load the data, just like we did in Steps 1 to 3 in the How 
to do it... section of this recipe. Then, follow these steps:
1.	
Import the scikit-learn transformers:
from sklearn.preprocessing import (
    StandardScaler, RobustScaler
)
2.	
Let’s set up StandardScaler() to learn and subtract the mean without dividing the result 
by the standard deviation:
scaler_mean = StandardScaler(
    with_mean=True, with_std=False,
).set_output(transform="pandas")
3.	
Now, let’s set up RobustScaler() so that it does not remove the median from the values 
but divides them by the value range – that is, the difference between the maximum and 
minimum values:
scaler_minmax = RobustScaler(
    with_centering=False,
    with_scaling=True,
    quantile_range=(0, 100)
).set_output(transform="pandas")
