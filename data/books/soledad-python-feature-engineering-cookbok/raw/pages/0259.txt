Creating New Features
236
Similarly, the ratio between the worst and the average characteristic of the cell nuclei might 
be indicative of malignancy.

Let’s create a new feature with the ratio between the worst and mean radius of the nuclei, and 
then display its values:
df["quotient"] = df["worst radius"].div(
    df["mean radius"])
df["quotient"].head()
In the following output, we can see the values corresponding to the ratio between the features:
0    1.410784
1    1.214876
2    1.197054
3    1.305604
4    1.110892
Name: quotient, dtype: float64
Note
We can calculate the ratio by executing an alternative command, df["quotient"] = 
df["worst radius"] / (df["mean radius"]).
We can also capture the ratio and difference between every nuclei morphology characteristic 
and the mean radius or mean area of the nuclei. Let’s begin by capturing these subsets of 
variables into lists.
5.	
Let’s make a list of the features in the numerator:
features = [
    "mean smoothness",
    «mean compactness",
    "mean concavity",
    "mean symmetry"
]
6.	
Let’s make a list of the features in the denominator:
reference = ["mean radius", "mean area"]
Note
We can create features by dividing the features in step 5 by one of the features in step 6 with 
pandas, by executing df[features].div(df["mean radius"]). For subtraction, 
we’d execute df[features].sub(df["mean radius"]).
