Scaling to vector unit length
225
This scaling procedure changes the variables’ distribution, as illustrated in the following figure:

after scaling each observation’s feature vector to its norm
Note
This scaling technique scales each observation and not each variable. The scaling methods that 
we discussed so far in this chapter aimed at shifting and resetting the scale of the variables’ 
distribution. When we scale to the unit length, however, we normalize each observation 
individually, contemplating their values across all features.
Scaling to the unit norm can be used when utilizing kernels to quantify similarity for text classification 
and clustering. In this recipe, we will scale each observation’s feature vector to a unit length of 1 
using scikit-learn.
