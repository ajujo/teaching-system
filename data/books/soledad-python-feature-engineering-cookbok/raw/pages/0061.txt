How it works...
In this recipe, we performed multivariate imputation using IterativeImputer() from scikit-
learn. When we fit the model, IterativeImputer() carried out the steps that we described in the 
introduction of the recipe. That is, it imputed all variables with the mean. Then it selected one variable 
and set its missing values back to missing. And finally, it fitted a Bayes regressor to estimate that variable 
based on the others. It repeated this procedure for each variable. That was one cycle of imputation.
