Working with Outliers
176
It’s worth noting that despite employing percentiles, the procedure didn’t precisely replace the 
same number of observations on both sides of the distribution. If you intend to winsorize your 
variables, compare the outcomes of your analyses before and after winsorization.
How it works...
We used pandas’ quantiles() to obtain the 5th and 95th percentiles of all the variables in the 
dataset, and combined it with to_dict() to retain those percentiles in dictionaries, where the 
keys were the variables and the values were the percentiles. We then passed these dictionaries to 
pandas’ clip() to replace values smaller or larger than those percentiles by the percentiles. By using 
dictionaries, we capped multiple variables at once.
