Transforming variables with the reciprocal function

Let’s check the distribution of the AveOccup variable after the transformation with the 
diagnostic function we created in step 3:
diagnostic_plots(X_tf, "AveOccup")
Note
After the transformation, AveOccup is now the ratio of the number of houses and the number 
of people in a certain area – in other words, houses per citizen.
Here, we can see a dramatic change in the distribution of the AveOccup variable after the 
reciprocal transformation:

Now, let’s apply the reciprocal transformation with scikit-learn.

Let’s import the FunctionTransformer():
from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer

Let’s set up the transformer by passing np.reciprocal as an argument:
transformer = FunctionTransformer(np.reciprocal)
Note
By default, FunctionTransformer() does not need to be fit before transforming the data.
