By executing X_test_scaled.max(), we see that the maximum values of the variables 
are around 1:
MedInc           1.000000
HouseAge        1.000000
AveRooms        1.071197

AveOccup        2.074553

Note
If you check the maximum values of the variables in the train set after the transformation, 
you’ll see that they are exactly 1. Yet, in the test set, we see values greater and smaller than 1. 
This occurs because, in the test set, there are observations with larger or smaller magnitudes 
than those in the train set. In fact, we see the greatest differences in the variables that deviate 
the most from the normal distribution (the last four variables in the dataset). This behavior 
is expected because scaling to the minimum and maximum values is sensitive to outliers and 
very skewed distributions.
Scaling to the minimum and maximum value does not change the shape of the variable’s distribution. 
You can corroborate that by displaying the histograms before and after the transformation.
How it works...
In this recipe, we scaled the variables of the California housing dataset to values between 0 and 1.
MinMaxScaler() from scikit-learn learned the minimum and maximum values and the value range 
of each variable when we called the fit() method and stored these parameters in its data_max_, 
min_, and data_range_ attributes. By using transform(), we made the scaler remove the 
minimum value from each variable in the train and test sets and divide the result by the value range.
Note
MinMaxScaler() will scale all variables by default. To scale only a subset of the 
variables in the dataset, you can use ColumnTransformer() from scikit-learn or 
SklearnTransformerWrapper() from Feature-engine.
MinMaxScaler() will scale the variables between 0 and 1 by default. However, we have the option 
to scale to a different range by adjusting the tuple passed to the feature_range parameter.
