Imputing Missing Data
10
We see the resulting DataFrame in the following image:
Figure 1.3 – Training set after the imputation. The imputed variables are marked by 
the imputer prefix; the untransformed variables show the prefix remainder
Finally, let’s perform median imputation using feature-engine.
13.	 Let’s set up the imputer to replace missing data in numerical variables with the median:
imputer = MeanMedianImputer(
    imputation_method="median",
    variables=numeric_vars,
)
Note
To perform mean imputation, change imputation_method to "mean". By default 
MeanMedianImputer() will impute all numerical variables in the DataFrame, ignoring 
categorical variables. Use the variables argument to restrict the imputation to a subset of 
numerical variables.
14.	 Fit the imputer so that it learns the median values:
imputer.fit(X_train)
15.	 Inspect the learned medians:
imputer.imputer_dict_
