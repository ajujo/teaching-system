Cleaning and stemming text variables
361
The cleaning steps we performed in this recipe resulted in strings containing the original text, without 
punctuation or numbers, in lowercase, without common words, and with the root of the word instead 
of its conjugated form. The data, as it is returned, can be used to derive features, as described in 
the Counting characters, words, and vocabulary recipe, or to create BoWs and TI-IDF matrices, as 
described in the Creating features with bag-of-words and n-grams and Implementing term frequency-
inverse document frequency recipes.
Cleaning the texts as we have shown in this recipe can incur data loss, depending on the characteristics 
of the text, and if we seek to interpret the models after creating BoW or TF-IDF matrices, understanding 
the importance of stemmed words may not be so straightforward.
