Extracting Features from Relational Data with Featuretools

Let’s now display the names of the created features:
feature_defs
In the following output, we see the names of the features that we created, including the sine 
and cosine of the price and quantity, and the cumulative transformations of these variables 
after grouping them by invoice number:
[<Feature: customer_id>,
<Feature: invoice>,
<Feature: stock_code>,
<Feature: description>,
<Feature: quantity>,
<Feature: price>,
<Feature: COSINE(price)>,
<Feature: COSINE(quantity)>,
<Feature: SINE(price)>,
<Feature: SINE(quantity)>,
<Feature: CUM_MAX(price) by invoice>,
<Feature: CUM_MAX(quantity) by invoice>,
<Feature: CUM_SUM(price) by invoice>,
<Feature: CUM_SUM(quantity) by invoice>,
<Feature: DIFF(price) by invoice>,
<Feature: DIFF(quantity) by invoice>,
<Feature: TIME_SINCE_PREVIOUS(invoice_date) by invoice>]
Note
The sine and cosine transformation of price and quantity will probably not add much value 
because these are not cyclical features. I kept these transformations in the recipe to show you 
how to apply transformation primitives in general, if you ever need them.
As you can see from the previous list, the new features were appended as new columns to the 
original DataFrame. You can display the final DataFrame by executing feature_matrix.
