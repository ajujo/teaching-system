Transforming Numerical Variables

The AveOccup variable shows a very strong right-skewed distribution, as shown in the 
following output:

Note
The AveOccup variable refers to the average number of household members – that is, the 
ratio between the number of people and the number of houses in a certain area. This is a 
promising variable for a reciprocal transformation. You can find more details about the variables 
and the dataset by executing data = fetch_california_housing() followed 
by print(data.DESCR).
Now, let’s apply the reciprocal transformation with NumPy.

First, let’s make a copy of the original DataFrame so that we can modify the values in the copy 
and not in the original one, which we will need for the rest of this recipe:
X_tf = X.copy()
Note
Remember that executing X_tf = X instead of using pandas’ copy() creates an additional 
view of the same data. Therefore, changes that are made in X_tf will be reflected in X as well.

Let’s apply the reciprocal transformation to the AveOccup variable:
X_tf["AveOccup"] = np.reciprocal(X_tf["AveOccup"])
