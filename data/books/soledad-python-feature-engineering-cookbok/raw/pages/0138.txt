Performing equal-width discretization
115
In this recipe, we will carry out equal-width discretization using pandas, scikit-learn, 
and feature-engine.
How to do it...
First, let’s import the necessary Python libraries and get the dataset ready:
1.	
Let’s import the libraries and functions:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
2.	
Let’s load the predictor and target variables of the California housing dataset:
X, y = fetch_california_housing(
    return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
Note
To avoid data leakage, we will find the intervals’ limits by using the variables in the train set. 
Then, we will use these limits to discretize the variables in train and test sets.
3.	
Let’s divide the data into train and test sets:
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)
Next, we will divide the continuous HouseAge variable into 10 intervals using pandas and 
the formula described at the beginning of the recipe.
4.	
Let’s capture the minimum and maximum values of HouseAge:
min_value = int(X_train["HouseAge"].min())
max_value = int(X_train["HouseAge"].max())
5.	
Let’s determine the interval width, which is the variable’s value range divided by the number 
of bins:
width = int((max_value - min_value) / 10)
If we execute print(width), we will obtain 5, which is the size of the intervals.
6.	
Now we need to define the interval limits and store them in a list:
interval_limits = [i for i in range(
    min_value, max_value, width)]
