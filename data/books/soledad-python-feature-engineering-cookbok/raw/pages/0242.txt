Implementing maximum absolute scaling
219
Getting ready
Maximum absolute scaling was specifically designed to scale sparse data. Thus, we will use a bag-of-
words dataset that contains sparse variables for the recipe. In this dataset, the variables are words, 
the observations are documents, and the values are the number of times each word appears in the 
document. Most entries in the data are 0.
We will use a dataset consisting of a bag of words, which is available in the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words), which 
is licensed under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

I downloaded and prepared a small bag of words representing a simplified version of one of those 
datasets. You will find this dataset in the accompanying GitHub repository: https://github.com/

tree/main/ch07-scaling.
How to do it...
Let’s begin by importing the required packages and loading the dataset:
1.	
Let’s import the required libraries and the scaler:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler
2.	
Let’s load the bag-of-words dataset:
data = pd.read_csv("bag_of_words.csv")
If we execute data.head(), we will see the DataFrame consisting of the words as columns, 
the documents as rows, and the number of times each word appeared in a document as values:
