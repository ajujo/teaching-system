Extracting Features from Relational Data with Featuretools
270
In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:
•	 Setting up an entity set and creating features automatically
•	 Creating features with general and cumulative operations
•	 Combining numerical features
•	 Extracting features from date and time
•	 Extracting features from text
•	 Creating features with aggregation primitives
Technical requirements
In this chapter, we will use pandas, matplotlib, and featuretools open source Python 
libraries. You can install featuretools with pip:
pip install featuretools
Additionally, you can do so with conda:
conda install -c conda-forge featuretools
These commands install the basic featuretools functionality, but we can install add-ons for 
creating features with natural language processing (NLP) or for using dask as the backend instead of 
pandas. For more information on how to install featuretools add-ons, including graphviz, 
check out their documentation here: https://docs.featuretools.com/en/v0.16.0/
getting_started/install.html.
We will work with the Online Retail II dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which
