Extracting features from time with pandas
185
Getting ready
We can extract hours, minutes, and seconds using the following pandas’ datetime properties:
•	 pandas.Series.dt.hour
•	 pandas.Series.dt.minute
•	 pandas.Series.dt.second
How to do it...
In this recipe, we’ll extract the hour, minute, and second part of a time variable. Let’s begin by 
importing the libraries and creating a sample dataset:
1.	
Let’s import pandas and numpy:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
2.	
Let’s begin by creating 20 datetime observations, starting on 2024-05-17 at midnight 
and followed by increments of 1 hour, 15 minutes, and 10 seconds. Next, we’ll capture the time 
range in a DataFrame and display the top five rows:
rng_ = pd.date_range(
    "2024-05-17", periods=20, freq="1h15min10s")
df = pd.DataFrame({"date": rng_})
df.head()
In the following output, we see the variable from Step 2, with a date part and a time part, 
and the values increasing by intervals of 1 hour, 15 minutes, and 10 seconds:
