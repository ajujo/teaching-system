Setting up an entity set and creating features automatically

10.	 Let’s now display the customers DataFrame:
es["customers"].head()
We can see in the following output that featuretools automatically created a DataFrame 
containing the customer’s unique identifier, followed by the date of the first invoice for this customer:
Figure 9.4 – DataFrame with information at the customer level
Note
Go ahead and display the DataFrame containing the products by executing es["items"].
head(). You can also evaluate the size of the different DataFrames using pandas’ shape 
function. You will notice that the number of rows in each DataFrame coincides with the number 
of unique invoices, customers, and products.
11.	 We can also display the relationships between these data tables as follows:
es.plot()
Note
To visualize the data relationships, you need to have graphviz installed. If you don’t, follow the 
instructions in the featuretools documentation to install it: https://featuretools.
alteryx.com/en/stable/install.html#installing-graphviz.
In the following output, we can see the relational datasets and their relationships:
