Encoding Categorical Variables
50
Note
ColumnTransformer() changes the name and order of the variables during the transformation. 
If the variable was encoded, it will append the encoder prefix and if the variable was not 
modified, it will append the remainder prefix.
To wrap up the recipe, let’s perform one-hot encoding with feature-engine.
16.	 Let’s import the encoder from feature-engine:
from feature_engine.encoding import OneHotEncoder
17.	 Let’s set up the encoder so that it returns k-1 binary variables:
ohe_enc = OneHotEncoder(drop_last=True)
Note
feature-engine’s OneHotEncoder() encodes all categorical variables by default. To encode a 
subset of the variables, pass the variable names in a list: OneHotEncoder(variables=["A1", 
"A4"]). To encode numerical variables, set the ignore_format parameter to True or 
cast the variables as objects.
18.	 Let’s fit the encoder to the train set so that it learns the categories and variables to encode:
ohe_enc.fit(X_train)
Note
To encode binary variables into k-1, and other categorical variables into k dummies, set the 
drop_last_binary parameter to True.
19.	 Let’s explore the variables that will be encoded:
ohe_enc.variables_
The transformer found and stored the variables of the object or categorical type, as shown in 
the following output:
['A1', 'A4', 'A5', 'A6', 'A7', 'A9', 'A10', 'A12', 'A13']
20.	 Let’s explore the categories for which dummy variables will be created:
ohe_enc.encoder_dict_
The following dictionary contains the categories that will be encoded in each variable:
 {'A1': ['a', 'b'],
 'A4': ['u', 'y', 'Missing'],
