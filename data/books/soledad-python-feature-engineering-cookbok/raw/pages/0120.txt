Using the square root to transform variables
97
Here, we can see the Poisson distribution in the output:
Figure 3.6 – The bar and Q-Q plots of the counts1 variable
5.	
Now, let’s make a copy of the dataset:
df_tf = df.copy()
6.	
Let’s apply the square root transformation to both variables:
df_tf[["counts1", "counts2"]] = np.sqrt(
    df[["counts1","counts2"]])
7.	
Let’s round the values to two decimals for a nicer visualization:
df_tf[["counts1", "counts2"]] = np.round(
    df_tf[["counts1", "counts2"]], 2)
8.	
Let’s plot the distribution of counts1 after the transformation:
diagnostic_plots(df_tf, "counts1")
We see a more stabilized variance, as the dots in the Q-Q plot follow the 45-degree diagonal 
more closely:
