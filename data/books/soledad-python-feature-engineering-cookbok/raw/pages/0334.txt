Extracting hundreds of features automatically from a time series
311
flagged with a unique identifier. There is also a dataset with a target variable that indicates in which 
of these 135 hours the office was occupied. Let’s load the data and make some plots to understand 
its patterns:
1.	
Let’s load pandas and matplotlib:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
2.	
Load the dataset and display the first five rows:
X = pd.read_csv(
    "occupancy.csv", parse_dates=["date"])
X.head()
In the following figure, we can see the dataset containing a unique identifier, followed by the 
date and time of the measurements and values for five time series capturing temperature, 
humidity, lights, and ​CO​ 2​ levels in the office:
Figure 10.2 – DataFrame with the time-series data
3.	
Let’s create a function to plot the time series from step 2 at a given hour (the id column is a 
unique identifier for each of the 135 hours of records):
def plot_timeseries(n_id):
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=3,
    figsize=(20, 10))
    X[X[«id»] == n_id]["temperature"].plot(
        ax=axes[0, 0], title="temperature")
    X[X[«id»] == n_id]["humidity"].plot(
        ax=axes[0, 1], title="humidity")
    X[X[«id»] == n_id]["light"].plot(
        ax=axes[0, 2], title="light")
    X[X[«id»] == n_id]["co2"].plot(
