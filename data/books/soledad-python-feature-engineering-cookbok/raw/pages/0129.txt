Transforming Numerical Variables

).set_output(transform="pandas")
transformer.fit(X)
Note
To avoid data leakage, the λ parameter should be learned from the train set and then used to 
transform the train and test sets. Thus, remember to split your data into train and test sets 
before fitting PowerTransformer().

Now, let’s transform the dataset:
X_tf = transformer.transform(X)
Note
scikit-learn’s PowerTransformer() stores the learned lambdas in its lambdas_ attribute, 
which you can display by executing transformer.lambdas_.
10.	 Let’s inspect the distributions of the transformed data with histograms:
X_tf.hist(bins=30, figsize=(12, 12), layout=(3, 3))
plt.show()
In the following output, we can see that the variables’ values are more evenly spread across 
their ranges:
