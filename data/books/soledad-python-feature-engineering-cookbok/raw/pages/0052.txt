Implementing forward and backward fill

The previous code returns the following plot, where we see intervals of time where data is missing:
Figure 1.5 – Time series data showing missing values
4.	
Let’s impute missing data by carrying the last observed value in any interval to the next valid value:
df_imputed = df.ffill()
You can verify the absence of missing data by executing df_imputed.isnull().sum().
5.	
Let’s now plot the complete dataset and overlay as a dotted line the values used for the imputation:
ax = df_imputed.plot(
    linestyle="-", marker=".", figsize=[10, 5])
df_imputed[df.isnull()].plot(
    ax=ax, legend=None, marker=".", color="r")
ax.set_title("Air passengers")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of passengers")
ax.set_xlabel("Time")
The previous code returns the following plot, where we see the values used to replace nan as 
dotted lines overlaid in between the continuous time series lines:
