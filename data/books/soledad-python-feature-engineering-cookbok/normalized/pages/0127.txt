Transforming Numerical Variables

3.
Let's drop the Latitude and Longitude variables:
X.drop(labels=["Latitude", "Longitude"], axis=1,
    inplace=True)
4.
Let's inspect the variable distributions with histograms:
X.hist(bins=30, figsize=(12, 12), layout=(3, 3))
plt.show()
In the following output, we can see that the MedInc variable shows a mild right-skewed
distribution, variables such as AveRooms and Population are heavily right-skewed, and
the HouseAge variable shows an even spread of values across its range:

5.
Let's capture the variable names in a list since we will use these in the following step:
variables = list(X.columns)
6.
Let's create a function that will plot Q-Q plots for all the variables in the data in two rows with
three plots each:
def make_qqplot(df):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6),
        constrained_layout=True)
