Performing Feature Scaling
216
By executing print(mean), we display the mean values per variable:
MedInc           3.866667
HouseAge        28.618702
AveRooms         5.423404
AveBedrms        1.094775
Population    1425.157323
AveOccup         3.040518
dtype: float64
5.
Now, let's determine the difference between the maximum and minimum values per variable:
ranges = X_train.max(axis=0)-X_train.min(axis=0)
By executing print(ranges), we display the value ranges per variable:
MedInc           14.500200
HouseAge         51.000000
AveRooms        131.687179
AveBedrms        33.733333
Population    35679.000000
AveOccup        598.964286
dtype: float64
Note
The pandas mean(), max(), and min() methods return a pandas series.

Now, we'll apply mean normalization to the train and test sets by utilizing the learned parameters:
X_train_scaled = (X_train - means) / ranges
X_test_scaled = (X_test - means) / ranges
Note
In order to transform future data, you will need to store these parameters, for example, in a
.txt or .csv file.
Step 6 returns pandas DataFrames with the transformed train and test sets. Go ahead and
compare the variables before and after the transformations. You'll see that the distributions did
not change, but the variables are centered at 0, and their values lie between -1 and 1.
