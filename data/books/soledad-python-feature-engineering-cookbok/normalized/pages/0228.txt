Figure 7.1 - Distribution of a normal and skewed variable before and after standardization.
The z-score (x axis in the bottom panels) indicates how many standard deviations an observation
deviates from the mean. When the z-score is 1, the observation lies 1 standard deviation to the right
of the mean, whereas when the z-score is -1, the sample is 1 standard deviation to the left of the mean.
In normally distributed variables, we can estimate the probability of a value being greater or smaller
than a given z-score, and this probability distribution is symmetric. The probability of an observation
being smaller than a z-score of -1 is equivalent to the probability of a value being greater than 1
(horizontal line in the bottom-left panel). This symmetry is fundamental to many statistical tests.
In skewed distributions, this symmetry does not hold. As illustrated in the bottom-right panel of
Figure 7.1 (horizontal lines), the probability of a value being smaller than -1 is different from that
of being greater than 1.
