Note
Because light consumption is a very good indicator of office occupancy, with very simple
features, we can obtain a predictive logistic regression model.
Now, let's learn how to specify the creation of different features for different time series.
8.
Let's create a dictionary with the names of the methods that we want to use to create features
from the light time series. We enter the method's names as keys, and if the methods take a
parameter, we pass it as an additional dictionary to the corresponding key; otherwise, we pass
None as the values:
light_feat = {
    «sum_values": None,
    "median": None,
    «standard_deviation": None,
    "quantile": [{"q": 0.2}, {"q": 0.7}],
}
9.
Now, let's create a dictionary with the features that we want to create from the co2 time series:
co2_feat = {
    «root_mean_square": None,
    «number_peaks": [{"n": 1}, {"n": 2}],
}
10.	 Let's combine these dictionaries into a new dictionary:
kind_to_fc_parameters = {
    «light»: light_feat,
    "co2": co2_feat,
}
11.	 Finally, let's use the dictionary from step 10 to create the features from both time series:
features = extract_features(
    X[[«id», «light», «co2»]],
    column_id="id",
    kind_to_fc_parameters=kind_to_fc_parameters,
)
