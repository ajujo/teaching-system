Creating Features from a Time Series with tsfresh
308
Creating features from time series can be very time-consuming; we need to apply various signal processing
and time-series analysis algorithms to identify and extract meaningful features. The tsfresh Python
package, which stands for Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on the basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests,
streamlines this process. It integrates 63 time-series characterization methods to compute more than
750 features automatically. Additionally, tsfresh includes a feature selection algorithm that identifies
the most predictive features for a given time series. By automating the application of complex timeseries methods, tsfresh bridges the gap between signal-processing experts and machine learning
practitioners, making it easier to extract valuable features from time-series data.
In this chapter, we will learn how to automatically create hundreds of features from time-series data
by utilizing tsfresh. Following that, we will discuss how to fine-tune this feature creation process
by selecting the most relevant features, extracting different features from different time series, and
integrating the feature creation process into a scikit-learn pipeline to classify time-series data.
In this chapter, we will go through the following recipes:
•	 Extracting hundreds of features automatically from a time series
•	 Automatically creating and selecting predictive features from time-series data
•	 Extracting different features from different time series
•	 Creating a subset of features identified through feature selection
•	 Embedding feature creation into a scikit-learn pipeline
Technical requirements
In this chapter, we will use the open source tsfresh Python library. You can install tsfresh with
pip by executing pip install tsfresh.
Note
If you have an old Microsoft operating system, you may need to update the Microsoft C++ build
tools to proceed with the tsfresh package's installation. Follow the steps in this thread to
do so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64261546/how-to-solveerror-microsoft-visual-c-14-0-or-greater-is-required-when-inst.
