We see the day_mo variable in the following output:

9.
Let's extract the day of the week, with values between 0 and 6 (from Monday to Sunday), in a
new column, then display the top rows:
data["day_week"] = data["date"].dt.dayofweek
data[["date", "day_mo", "day_week"]].head()
We see the day_week variable in the following output:
Figure 6.7 - The top rows of a DataFrame with a new variable representing days of a week
10.	 With the variable from Step 9, we can create a binary variable that indicates whether it was
a weekend:
data["is_weekend"] = (
    data[«date»].dt.dayofweek > 4).astype(int)
data[["date", "day_week", "is_weekend"]].head()
