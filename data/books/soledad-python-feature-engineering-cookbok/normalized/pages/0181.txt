Working with Outliers

Figure 5.3 - Boxplot and histogram of the HouseAge variable
10.	 Let's find the variable's limits according to the IQR proximity rule:
lower_limit, upper_limit = find_limits(
    X, "HouseAge", 1.5)
If we execute lower_limit and upper_limit, we will see the values -10.5 and 65.5, which
are beyond the edges of the plots, and hence we don't see any outliers.
How it works...
In this recipe, we used the boxplot method from Seaborn to create the boxplots and then we calculated
the limits beyond which a value could be considered an outlier based on the IQR proximity rule.
In Figure 5.2, we saw that the box in the boxplot for MedInc extended from approximately 2 to 5,
corresponding to the first and third quantiles (you can determine these values precisely by executing
X["MedInc"].quantile(0.25) and X["MedInc"].quantile(0.75)). We also saw that
the whiskers start at MedInc's minimum on the left and extend up to 8.013 on the right (we know
this value exactly because we calculated it in step 8). MedInc showed values greater than 8.013,
which were displayed in the boxplot as dots. Those are the values that could be considered outliers.
In Figure 5.3, we displayed the boxplot for the HouseAge variable. The box included values ranging
from approximately 18 to 35 (you can determine the precise values by executing X["HouseAge"].
quantile(0.25) and X["HouseAge"].quantile(0.75)). The whiskers extended to the
minimum and maximum values of the distribution. The limits of the whiskers in the plot did not
coincide with those based on the IQR proximity rule (which we calculated in step 10) because these
limits were far beyond the value range observed for this variable.
