Extracting Features from Relational Data with Featuretools
296
Note
For a full list of the default text primitives, visit https://featuretools.alteryx.

In addition, there is an accompanying Python library, nlp_primitives, which contains additional
primitives to create more advanced features based on NLP. Among these functions, we find primitives
for determining the diversity score, the polarity score, or the count of stop words.
Note
There is no documentation at the time of writing to learn more about the primitives
supported by the nlp_primitives library, so to find out more, you need to
check the source code: https://github.com/alteryx/nlp_primitives/
tree/6243ef2379501bfec2c3f19e35a30b5954605e57/nlp_primitives.
In this recipe, we will first create multiple features from a text variable utilizing featuretools'
default functionality and then highlight how to use primitives from the nlp_primitives library.
Getting ready
To follow along with this recipe, you need to install the nlp_primitives library, which you can
do with pip:
pip install nlp_primitives
Otherwise, you can use conda:
conda install -c conda-forge nlp-primitives

How to do it...
Let's begin by importing the libraries and getting the dataset ready:
1.
First, we'll import pandas, featuretools, and the logical types:
import pandas as pd
import featuretools as ft
from woodwork.logical_types import (
   Categorical, NaturalLanguage)
