Extracting Features
from Date and Time Variables
Date and time variables contain information about dates, times, or both, and in programming, we
refer to them collectively as datetime features. Date of birth, the time of an event, and the date and
time of the last payment are examples of datetime variables.
Because of their nature, datetime features typically exhibit high cardinality. This means that they
contain a huge number of unique values, each corresponding to a specific date and/or time combination.
We don't normally use datetime variables for machine learning models in their raw format. Instead,
we enrich the dataset by extracting multiple features from these variables. These new features will
typically have reduced cardinality, and allow us to capture meaningful information, such as trends,
seasonality, and important events and tendencies.
In this chapter, we will explore how to extract features from dates and time by utilizing the pandas
dt module, and then automate this procedure with feature-engine.
This chapter will cover the following recipes:
•	 Extracting features from dates with pandas
•	 Extracting features from time with pandas
•	 Capturing elapsed time between datetime variables
•	 Working with time in different time zones
•	 Automating datetime feature extraction with feature-engine
Technical requirements
In this chapter, we will use the pandas, numpy, and feature-engine Python libraries.
