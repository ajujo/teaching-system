This book would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of those who contribute to the
Python open source ecosystem for data science and machine learning. We often overlook the fact
that these contributors are real people with families, jobs, and hobbies, who generously allocate their
time to develop these essential tools. I am deeply grateful to the developers of scikit-learn and pandas,
pivotal libraries for data analysis and processing, as well as the maintainers of tsfresh and category
encoders. A special acknowledgment goes to Nathan Parsons, current maintainer of Featuretools, for
his invaluable support in crafting Chapter 8 of this book.
I am grateful to my editor, Tiksha Abhimanyu Lad, and her team for their invaluable support in
bringing this book to fruition. Special thanks to our technical reviewer, Hector Patiño, for meticulously
reviewing the code and recipes, ensuring smooth execution, and providing valuable resources to our
readers.
A heartfelt thank you to my friend Chris Samiullah for his invaluable support in my growth as a
software developer.
Finally, I am grateful to the users and contributors of Feature-engine for their unwavering support,
feedback, and engagement, which have been instrumental in shaping the functionality of the library.
Lastly, I owe a debt of gratitude to my students, whose feedback and encouragement have helped me
become a better instructor and writer.
Thank you all for your invaluable contributions to this endeavor.
