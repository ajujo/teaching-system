Encoding Categorical Variables
44
Technical requirements
In this chapter, we will use the Matplotlib, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, featureengine, and Category Encoders Python libraries. If you need to install Python, the free Anaconda
Python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/) includes most numerical computing libraries.
feature-engine can be installed with pip:
pip install feature-engine
If you use Anaconda, you can install feature-engine with conda:
conda install -c conda-forge feature_engine
To install Category Encoders, use pip as follows:
pip install category_encoders
We will use the Credit Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://
archive.ics.uci.edu/), licensed under the CC BY 4.0 creative commons attribution: https://
creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode. You'll find the dataset at this
link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval.
I downloaded and modified the data as shown in this notebook: https://github.com/

blob/main/ch02-categorical-encoding/credit-approval-dataset.ipynb.
You'll find a copy of the modified data set in the accompanying GitHub repository: https://

Note
Before encoding categorical variables, you might want to impute their missing data. Check out
the imputation methods for categorical variables in Chapter 1, Imputing Missing Data.
Creating binary variables through one-hot encoding
One-hot encoding is a method used to represent categorical data, where each category is represented
by a binary variable. The binary variable takes a value of 1 if the category is present, or 0 otherwise.
The following table shows the one-hot encoded representation of the Smoker variable with the
categories of Smoker and Non-Smoker:
