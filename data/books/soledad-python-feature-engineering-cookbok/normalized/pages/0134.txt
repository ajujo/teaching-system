Performing Yeo-Johnson transformations

Figure 3.14 - Histograms of the variables after the yeo-Johnson transformation
Finally, let's implement the Yeo-Johnson transformation with Feature-engine.
7.
Let's set up YeoJohnsonTransformer() to transform all numerical variables and then
fit it to the data:
yjt = YeoJohnsonTransformer()
yjt.fit(X)
Note
If the variables argument is left set to None, the transformer selects and transforms all
the numerical variables in the dataset. Alternatively, we can pass the names of the variables to
modify in a list.
Compared to PowerTransformer() from scikit-learn, Feature-engine's transformer can
take the entire DataFrame as an argument of the fit() and transform() methods, and
yet it will only modify the selected variables.

Let's transform the variables:
X_tf = yjt.transform(X)
