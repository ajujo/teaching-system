Removing observations with missing data

Removing observations with missing data
Complete Case Analysis (CCA), also called list-wise deletion of cases, consists of discarding observations
with missing data. CCA can be applied to both categorical and numerical variables. With CCA, we
preserve the distribution of the variables after the imputation, provided the data is missing at random
and only in a small proportion of observations. However, if data is missing across many variables,
CCA may lead to the removal of a large portion of the dataset.
Note
Use CCA only when a small number of observations are missing and you have good reasons
to believe that they are not important to your model.
How to do it...
Let's begin by making some imports and loading the dataset:
1.
Let's import pandas, matplotlib, and the train/test split function from scikit-learn:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
2.
Let's load and display the dataset described in the Technical requirements section:
data = pd.read_csv("credit_approval_uci.csv")
data.head()
In the following image, we see the first 5 rows of data:

3.
Let's proceed as we normally would if we were preparing the data to train machine learning
models; by splitting the data into a training and a test set:
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    data.drop("target", axis=1),
    data["target"],
