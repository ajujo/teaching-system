Creating binary variables through one-hot encoding

Figure 2.1 - One-hot encoded representation of the Smoker variable
As shown in Figure 2.1, from the Smoker variable, we can derive a binary variable for Smoker,
which shows the value of 1 for smokers, or the binary variable for Non-Smoker, which takes the
value of 1 for those who do not smoke.
For the Color categorical variable with the values of red, blue, and green, we can create three
variables called red, blue, and green. These variables will be assigned a value of 1 if the observation
corresponds to the respective color, and 0 if it does not.
A categorical variable with k unique categories can be encoded using k-1 binary variables. For
Smoker, k is 2 as it contains two labels (Smoker and Non-Smoker), so we only need one binary
variable (k - 1 = 1) to capture all the information. For the Color variable, which has 3 categories (k
= 3; red, blue, and green), we need 2 (k - 1 = 2) binary variables to capture all the information
so that the following occurs:
•	 If the observation is red, it will be captured by the red variable (red = 1, blue = 0)
•	 If the observation is blue, it will be captured by the blue variable (red = 0, blue = 1)
•	 If the observation is green, it will be captured by the combination of red and blue (red =
0, blue = 0)
Encoding into k-1 binary variables is well suited for linear models. There are a few occasions in which
we may prefer to encode the categorical variables with k binary variables:
•	 When training decision trees, since they do not evaluate the entire feature space at the same time
•	 When selecting features recursively
•	 When determining the importance of each category within a variable
