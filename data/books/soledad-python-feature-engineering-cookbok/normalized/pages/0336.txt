Extracting hundreds of features automatically from a time series

Figure 10.4 - Time-series values during the fifteenth hour of data collection, when the office was occupied
Notice that the lights were on this time (top-right panel).
In this recipe, we will extract features from each of these one-hour windows of time-series data,
capturing various aspects of their characteristics. From each of these 60-minute time-series segments,
we will automatically generate more than 750 features using tsfresh, ensuring a comprehensive
representation of the data's properties.
How to do it...
We will begin by automatically creating hundreds of features from one time series, lights, and then
use those features to predict whether the office was occupied at any given hour:
1.
Let's import the required Python libraries and functions:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tsfresh import extract_features
from tsfresh.utilities.dataframe_functions import (
    impute
)
2.
Load the dataset described in the Technical requirements section:
X = pd.read_csv("occupancy.csv", parse_dates=["date"])
