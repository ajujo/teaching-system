Working with Outliers
An outlier is a data point that diverges notably from other values within a variable. Outliers may stem
from the inherent variability of the feature itself, manifesting as extreme values that occur infrequently
within the distribution (typically found in the tails). They can be the result of experimental errors
or inaccuracies in data collection processes, or they can signal important events. For instance, an
unusually high expense in a card transaction may indicate fraudulent activity, warranting flagging and
potentially blocking the card to safeguard customers. Similarly, unusually distinct tumor morphologies
can suggest malignancy, prompting further examination.
Outliers can exert a disproportionately large impact on a statistical analysis. For example, a small
number of outliers can reverse the statistical significance of a test in either direction (think A/B testing)
or directly influence the estimation of the parameters of the statistical model (think coefficients). Some
machine learning models are well known for being susceptible to outliers, such as linear regression.
Other models are known for being robust to outliers, such as decision-tree-based models. AdaBoost
is said to be sensitive to outliers in the target variable, and in principle, distance-based models, such
as PCA and KNN, could also be affected by the presence of outliers.
There isn't a strict mathematical definition for what qualifies as an outlier, and there is also no consensus
on how to handle outliers in statistical or machine learning models. If outliers stem from flawed data
collection, discarding them seems like a safe option. However, in many datasets, pinpointing the exact
nature of outliers is challenging. Ultimately, detecting and handling outliers remains a subjective
exercise, reliant on domain knowledge and an understanding of their potential impact on models.
In this chapter, we will begin by discussing methods to identify potential outliers, or more precisely,
observations that significantly deviate from the rest. Then, we'll proceed under the assumption that
these observations are not relevant for the analysis, and show how to either remove them or reduce
their impact on models through truncation.
This chapter contains the following recipes:
•	 Visualizing outliers with boxplots and the inter-quartile proximity rule
•	 Finding outliers using the mean and standard deviation
