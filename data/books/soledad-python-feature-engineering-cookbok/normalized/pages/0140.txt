Performing equal-width discretization
117
Note
The parentheses and brackets in the intervals indicate whether a value is included in the interval
or not. For example, the (41, 46] interval contains all values greater than 41 and smaller than
or equal to 46.
Equal-width discretization allocates a different number of observations to each interval.
11.	 Let's make a bar plot with the proportion of observations across the intervals of HouseAge
in the train and test sets:
t1 = train_t["HouseAge_disc"].value_counts(
    normalize=True, sort=False)
t2 = test_t["HouseAge_disc"].value_counts(
    normalize=True, sort=False)
tmp = pd.concat([t1, t2], axis=1)
tmp.columns = ["train", "test"]
tmp.plot.bar(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.ylabel("Number of observations per bin")
plt.xlabel('Discretized HouseAge')
plt.title("HouseAge")
plt.show()
In the following output, we can see that the proportion of observations per interval is approximately
the same in the train and test sets, but different across intervals:
