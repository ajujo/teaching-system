Note
In step 4, we entered the invoice_date variable as a time variable. Thus, featuretools
will use this variable to create date- and time-related features.
11.	 Let's display the names of the created features:
feature_defs
In the following output, we see the names of the original and time features:
[<Feature: customer_id>,
<Feature: DAY(first_data_time)>,
<Feature: DAYS_IN_MONTH(first_data_time)>,
<Feature: DISTANCE_TO_HOLIDAY(
     first_data_time, holiday=Boxing Day, country=UK)>,
<Feature: HOUR(first_data_time)>,
<Feature: IS_FEDERAL_HOLIDAY(
     first_data_time, , country=UK)>,
<Feature: MINUTE(first_data_time)>,
<Feature: MONTH(first_data_time)>,
<Feature: PART_OF_DAY(first_data_time)>,
<Feature: WEEKDAY(first_data_time)>,
<Feature: YEAR(first_data_time)>]
Go ahead and execute feature_matrix.head() to take a look at the resulting DataFrame
with the features created from the invoice date. The DataFrame is quite big, so for reasons of
space, we'll only display a few columns in the book.
12.	 Let's display the resulting DataFrame containing three of the new features:
columns = [
    "DISTANCE_TO_HOLIDAY(first_data_time,
        holiday=Boxing Day, country=UK)",
    "HOUR(first_data_time)",
    "IS_FEDERAL_HOLIDAY(first_data_time,
        country=UK)",
]
feature_matrix[columns].head()
