These feature vectors, which are represented as x 1, x 2, and x 3 in Figure 10.1, should capture the
characteristics of the time series. For example, x 1could be the mean value of the time series and x 2its
variance. We can create many features to characterize the time series concerning the distribution of
data points, correlation properties, stationarity, or entropy, among others. Therefore, the feature vector,
N, can be constructed by applying a series of characterization methods that take a time series as
input and return one or more scalars as output. The mean, or the sum, takes the time-series sequence
as input and returns a single scalar as output, with the mean value of the time series or the sum of its
values. We can also fit a linear trend to the time-series sequence, which will return two scalars - one
with the slope and one with the intercept.
tsfresh applies 63 characterization methods to a time series, each of which returns one or more
scalars, therefore resulting in more than 750 features for any given time series. In this recipe, we will
use tsfresh to transform time-series data into an M x N feature table, which we will then use to
predict office occupancy.
Getting ready
In this recipe, we will use the Occupancy Detection dataset described in the Technical requirements
section. This dataset contains measurements of temperature, humidity, CO 2 level, and light consumption
in an office taken at one-minute intervals. There are 135 hours of measurements, and each hour is
