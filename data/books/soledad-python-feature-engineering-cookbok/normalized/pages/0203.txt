Extracting Features from Date and Time Variables
180
We see the new year variable in the following output:
Figure 6.2 - First five rows of the DataFrame with the year variable extracted from the date
4.
Let's extract the quarter of the year out of the date into a new column and display the top five rows:
data["quarter"] = data["date"].dt.quarter
data[["date", "quarter"]].head()
We see the new quarter variable in the following output:
Figure 6.3 - The first five rows of a DataFrame with the quarter variable extracted from the date
5.
With quarter, we can now create the semester feature:
data["semester"] = np.where(data["quarter"] < 3, 1, 2)
Note
You can explore the distinct values of the new variables utilizing pandas' unique(), for
example, by executing df["quarter"].unique() or df["semester"].unique().
