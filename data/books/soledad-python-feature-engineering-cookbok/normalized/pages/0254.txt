Combining features with mathematical functions
231
The preceding code block should print out a description of the dataset and an interpretation of
its variables.
How to do it...
In this recipe, we will create new features by combining variables using multiple mathematical operations:
1.
Let's begin by loading the necessary libraries, classes, and data:
import pandas as pd
from feature_engine.creation import MathFeatures
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
2.
Next, load the breast cancer dataset into a pandas DataFrame:
data = load_breast_cancer()
df = pd.DataFrame(data.data,
    columns=data.feature_names)
In the following code lines, we will create new features by combining variables using multiple
mathematical operations.
3.
Let's begin by creating a list with the subset of the features that we want to combine:
features = [
    «mean smoothness",
    «mean compactness",
    «mean concavity",
    «mean concave points",
    «mean symmetry",
]
The features in step 3 represent the mean characteristics of cell nuclei in the images. It might
be useful to obtain the mean across all examined characteristics.
4.
Let's get the mean value of the features and then display the resulting feature:
df["mean_features"] = df[features].mean(axis=1)
df["mean_features"].head()
The following output shows the mean value of the features from step 3:
0    0.21702
1    0.10033
2    0.16034
3    0.20654
4    0.14326
