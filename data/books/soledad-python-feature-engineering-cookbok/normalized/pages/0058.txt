Performing multivariate imputation by chained equations
35
MICE involves the following steps:
1.
First, it performs a simple univariate imputation to every variable with missing data. For
example, median imputation.
2.
Next, it selects one specific variable, say, var_1, and sets the missing values back to missing.
3.
It trains a model to predict var_1 using the other variables as input features.
4.
Finally, it replaces the missing values of var_1 with the output of the model.
MICE repeats steps 2 to 4 for each of the remaining variables.
An imputation cycle concludes once all the variables have been modeled. MICE carries out multiple
imputation cycles, typically 10. That is, we repeat steps 2 to 4 for each variable 10 times. The idea is
that by the end of the cycles, we should have found the best possible estimates of the missing data
for each variable.
Note
Multivariate imputation can be a useful alternative to univariate imputation in situations where
we don't want to distort the variable distributions. Multivariate imputation is also useful when
we are interested in having good estimates of the missing data.
In this recipe, we will implement MICE using scikit-learn.
How to do it...
To begin the recipe, let's import the required libraries and load the data:
1.
Let's import the required Python libraries, classes, and functions:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import BayesianRidge
from sklearn.experimental import (
    enable_iterative_imputer
)
from sklearn.impute import (
    IterativeImputer,
    SimpleImputer
)
