Performing Variable Discretization
126
In the following plot, we can see that the bins contain a similar fraction of observations:
Figure 4.4 - The proportion of observations per interval of HouseAge after equal-frequency discretization
With feature-engine, we can apply equal-frequency discretization to multiple variables.
9.
Let's import the discretizer:
from feature_engine.discretisation import
EqualFrequencyDiscretiser
10.	 Let's set up the transformer to discretize three continuous variables into eight bins:
variables = ['MedInc', 'HouseAge', 'AveRooms']
disc = EqualFrequencyDiscretiser(
    q=8, variables=variables, return_boundaries=True)
Note
With return_boundaries=True, the transformer will return the interval boundaries
after the discretization. To return the interval number, set it to False.
