Note
ReferenceFeatures() can also add, multiply, get the modulo, or get the power of a
group of variables relating to a second group of reference variables. You can find out more in
its documentation: https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
api_doc/creation/RelativeFeatures.html.

Performing polynomial expansion
Simple models, such as linear and logistic regression, can capture complex patterns if we feed them
the right features. Sometimes, we can create powerful features by combining the variables in our
datasets with themselves or with other variables. For example, in the following figure, we can see that
the target, y, has a quadratic relation with the variable, x, and as shown in the left panel, a linear model
is not able to capture that relationship accurately:
Figure 8.4 - A linear model fit to predict a target, y, from a feature, x, which has a quadratic relationship to
the target, before and after squaring x. In the left panel: the model offers a poor fit by using the original
variable; in the right panel, the model offers a better fit, based on the square of the original variable
This linear model has a quadratic relationship to the target, before and after squaring x. However, if we
square x, or, in other words, if we create a second-degree polynomial of the feature, the linear model
can accurately predict the target, y, from the square of x, as we see in the right panel.
