How it works...
To create features using general and cumulative transformations with featuretools, we first need
to set up an entity set with the data and define the relationships between its variables. We described
how to set up an entity set in the Setting up an entity set and creating features automatically recipe.
To apply cumulative and general transforms, we used the dfs class from featuretools. General
transformations are applied to the entire DataFrame without grouping by a specific variable. To
perform general transformations, we passed a list of strings with the transformation names to the
trans_primitives parameter from dfs.
We applied cumulative transformation after grouping by invoice. To do this, we passed a list of strings
with the names of the cumulative transformation to the groupby_trans_primitives parameter
from dfs. The featuretools library knows it should group by invoice because we established
this unique identifier by using the normalize_dataframe method from EntitySet in step 5.
