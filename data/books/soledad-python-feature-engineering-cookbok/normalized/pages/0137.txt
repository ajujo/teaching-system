Performing Variable Discretization
114
Discretization procedures can be classified as supervised and unsupervised. Unsupervised discretization
methods only use the variable's distribution to determine the limits of the contiguous bins. On the
other hand, supervised methods use target information to create the intervals.
In this chapter, we will discuss widely used supervised and unsupervised discretization procedures
that are available in established open source libraries. Among these, we will cover equal-width, equalfrequency, arbitrary, k-means, and decision tree-based discretization. More elaborate methods, such
as ChiMerge and CAIM, are out of the scope of this chapter, as their implementation is not yet open
source available.
This chapter contains the following recipes:
•	 Performing equal-width discretization
•	 Implementing equal-frequency discretization
•	 Discretizing the variable into arbitrary intervals
•	 Performing discretization with k-means clustering
•	 Implementing feature binarization
•	 Using decision trees for discretization
Technical requirements
In this chapter, we will use the numerical computing libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib,
scikit-learn, and feature-engine. We will also use the yellowbrick Python open
source library, which you can install with pip:
 pip install yellowbrick

Performing equal-width discretization
Equal-width discretization consists of dividing the range of observed values for a variable into k
equally sized intervals, where k is supplied by the user. The interval width for the X variable is given
by the following:
Width =  Max (X) − Min(X)

_____________
k

Then, if the values of the variable vary between 0 and 100, we can create five bins like this: width =
(100-0) / 5 = 20. The bins will be 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, and 80-100. The first and final bins (0-20 and
80-100) can be expanded to accommodate values smaller than 0 or greater than 100 by extending
the limits to minus and plus infinity.
