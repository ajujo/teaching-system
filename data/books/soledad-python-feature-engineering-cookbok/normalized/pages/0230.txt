Standardizing the features

5.
Now, let's standardize the train and test sets with the trained scaler:
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
StandardScaler() stores the mean and standard deviation learned from the training set
during fit(). Let's visualize the learned parameters.
6.
First, we'll print the mean values that were learned by scaler:
scaler.mean_
We see the mean values of each variable in the following output:
array([3.86666741e+00, 2.86187016e+01,
5.42340368e+00,                 1.09477484e+00,1.42515732e+03,
3.04051776e+00])
7.
Now, let's print the standard deviation values that were learned by scaler:
scaler.scale_
We see the standard deviation of each variable in the following output:
array([1.89109236e+00, 1.25962585e+01,
2.28754018e+00,                          4.52736275e-01,
1.14954037e+03, 6.86792905e+00])
Let's compare the transformed data with the original data to understand the changes.
8.
Let's print the descriptive statistics from the original variables in the test set:
X_test.describe()
In the following output, we see that the variables' mean values are different from zero and the
variance varies:
