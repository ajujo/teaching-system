Extracting different features from different time series

3.
Display the feature creation methods that will be applied when using the dictionary that returns
the fewest features:
minimal_feat = settings.MinimalFCParameters()
minimal_feat.items()
In the output of step 3, we see a dictionary with the feature extraction method names as keys,
and the parameters used by those methods, if any, as values:
ItemsView({'sum_values': None, 'median': None, 'mean': None,
'length': None, 'standard_deviation': None, 'variance': None,
'root_mean_square': None, 'maximum': None, 'absolute_maximum':
None, 'minimum': None})

Go ahead and explore the other two predefined dictionaries, s e t t i n g s .
ComprehensiveFCParameters and settings.EfficientFCParameters, by
adapting the code from step 3.

Now, let's use the dictionary from step 3 to extract only those features from the light time
series and then display the shape of the resulting DataFrame:
features = extract_features(
    X[[«id», «light»]],
    column_id="id",
    default_fc_parameters=minimal_feat,
)
features.shape
The output of step 4 is (135, 10), which means that only 10 features were created for each
of the 135 hours of light consumption data.
5.
Let's display the resulting DataFrame:
features.head()
We see the values of the resulting features for the first five hours of light consumption in the
following DataFrame:
