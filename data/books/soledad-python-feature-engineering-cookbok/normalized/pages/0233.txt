Figure 7.4 - Distribution of a normal and skewed variable before and
after scaling to the minimum and maximum value
This scaling method standardizes the maximum value of the variables to a unit size. Scaling to the
minimum and maximum value tends to be the preferred alternative to standardization, and it is
suitable for variables with very small standard deviations and when we want to preserve zero entries
in sparse data, such as in one-hot encoded variables, or variables derived from counts, such as bag
of words. However, this procedure does not center the variables at zero, so if the algorithm has that
requirement, this method might not be the best choice.
Note
Scaling to the minimum and maximum values is sensitive to outliers. If outliers are present in
the training set, the scaling will squeeze the values toward one of the tails. If, on the contrary,
outliers are in the test set, the variable will show values greater than 1 or smaller than 0 after
scaling, depending on whether the outlier is on the left or right tail.
