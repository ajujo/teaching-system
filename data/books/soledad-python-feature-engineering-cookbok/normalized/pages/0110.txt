Transforming variables with the logarithm function
87
Note
If we execute X_tf = X instead of using pandas' copy()function, X_tf will not be a copy
of the DataFrame; instead, it will be another view of the same data. Therefore, changes made
in X_tf will be reflected in X as well.

Let's make a list with the variables that we want to transform:
vars = ["MedInc", "AveRooms", "AveBedrms",
    "Population"]
8.
Let's apply the logarithmic transformation with NumPy to the variables from step 7 and capture
the transformed variables in the new DataFrame:
X_tf[vars] = np.log(X[vars])
Note
Remember that the logarithm transformation can only be applied to strictly positive variables.
If the variables have zero or negative values, sometimes, it is useful to add a constant to
make those values positive. We could add a constant value of 1 using X_tf[vars] =
np.log(X[vars] + 1).
9.
Let's check the distribution of MedInc after the transformation with the diagnostic function
from step 4:
diagnostic_plots(X_tf, "MedInc")
In the following output, we can see that the logarithmic transformation returned a more evenly
distributed variable that better approximates the theoretical normal distribution in the Q-Q plot:
