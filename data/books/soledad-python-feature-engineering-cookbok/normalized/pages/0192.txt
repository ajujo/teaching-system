Removing outliers
169
Note
We discussed the code in step 10 in the Visualizing outliers with boxplots recipe earlier in
this chapter.
11.	 Let's plot the distribution of MedInc before removing the outliers:
plot_boxplot_and_hist(X_train, "MedInc")
In the following plot, we see that MedInc is skewed and observations greater than 8 are
marked as outliers:
Figure 5.7- Boxplot and the histogram of MedInc before removing outliers.
12.	 Finally, let's plot the distribution of MedInc after removing the outliers:
plot_boxplot_and_hist(train_t, "MedInc")
After removing outliers, MedInc seems less skewed and its values more evenly distributed:
