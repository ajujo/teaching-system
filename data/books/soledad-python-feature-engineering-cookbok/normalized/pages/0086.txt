Replacing categories with ordinal numbers
63
Now, let's do ordinal encoding with feature-engine.
11.	 Let's import the encoder:
from feature_engine.encoding import OrdinalEncoder
12.	 Let's set up the encoder so that it replaces categories with arbitrary integers in the categorical
variables specified in Step 7:
enc = OrdinalEncoder(
    encoding_method="arbitrary",
    variables=cat_vars,
)
Note
feature-engine's OrdinalEncoder() automatically finds and encodes all categorical
variables if the variables parameter is None. Alternatively, it will encode the variables
indicated in the list. In addition, it can assign the integers according to the target mean value
(see the Performing ordinal encoding based on the target value recipe).
13.	 Let's fit the encoder to the train set so that it learns and stores the category-to-integer mappings:
enc.fit(X_train)
Note
The category to integer mappings are stored in the encoder_dict_ attribute and can be
accessed by executing enc.encoder_dict_.
14.	 Finally, let's encode the categorical variables in the train and test sets:
X_train_enc = enc.transform(X_train)
X_test_enc = enc.transform(X_test)
feature-engine returns pandas DataFrames where the values of the original variables are
replaced with numbers, leaving the DataFrame ready to use in machine learning models.
How it works...
In this recipe, we replaced categories with integers assigned arbitrarily.
We used pandas' unique() to find the unique categories of the A7 variable. Next, we created a dictionary
of category-to-integer and passed it to pandas' map() to replace the strings in A7 with the integers.
