Working with Outliers
156
Note
As shown in Figure 5.1, the boxplot returns asymmetric boundaries denoted by the varying
lengths of the left and right whiskers. This makes boxplots a suitable method for identifying
outliers in highly skewed distributions. As we'll see in the coming recipes, alternative methods
to identify outliers create symmetric boundaries around the center of the distribution, which
may not be the best option for asymmetric distributions.

Let's now create a function to plot a boxplot next to a histogram:
def plot_boxplot_and_hist(data, variable):
    f, (ax_box, ax_hist) = plt.subplots(
        2, sharex=True,
        gridspec_kw={"height_ratios": (0.50, 0.85)})
    sns.boxplot(x=data[variable], ax=ax_box)
    sns.histplot(data=data, x=variable, ax=ax_hist)
    plt.show()

Let's use the previous function to create the plots for the MedInc variable:
plot_boxplot_and_hist(X, "MedInc")
In the following figure, we can see the relationship between the boxplot and the variable's
distribution shown in the histogram. Note how most of MedInc's observations are located
within the IQR box. MedInc's potential outliers lie on the right tail, corresponding to people
with unusually high-income salaries:
