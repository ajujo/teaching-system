Creating New Features
258
If we execute df.head(), we will see the first five rows of the toy DataFrame:
Figure 8.16 - The toy DataFrame with three cyclical features
9.
Set up the transformer to create the sine and cosine features from these variables:
cyclic = CyclicalFeatures(
    variables=None,
    drop_original=False,
)
Note
By setting variables to None, CyclicalFeatures() will create trigonometric features
from all numerical variables. To create trigonometric features from a subset of variables, we
can pass the variables' names in a list to the variables parameter. We can retain or drop the
original variables after creating the cyclical features using the drop_original parameter.
10.	 To finish, add the features to the DataFrame and capture the result in a new variable:
dft = cyclic.fit_transform(df)
If we execute dft.head(), we will see the original and new features:
Figure 8.17 - DataFrame with cyclical features plus the features
created through the sine and cosine functions
And that's it - we've created features by using the sine and cosine transformation automatically from
multiple variables and added them directly to the original DataFrame.
