Transforming variables with the logarithm function

Let's explore the distributions of all the variables in the dataset by plotting histograms with pandas:
X.hist(bins=30, figsize=(12, 12))
plt.show()
In the following output, we can see that the MedInc variable shows a mild right-skewed
distribution, variables such as AveRooms and Population are heavily right-skewed, and
the HouseAge variable shows an even spread of values across its range:
