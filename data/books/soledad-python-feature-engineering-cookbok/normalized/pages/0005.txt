Foreword
From convolutional neural networks to XGBoost, when it comes to machine learning, it's easy to
focus too much on the algorithms. But as the saying goes, "Garbage in, garbage out." The quality of the
features can be more important than the machine learning algorithm itself. Despite advances in feature
learning, such as embedding in neural networks, feature engineering remains as important as ever.
Particularly when dealing with categorical, numerical, and time-series features, feature engineering
is a critical skill. With the right features, you can greatly improve model performance and ensure that
models are more interpretable and robust.
Sole is a remarkable data science and machine learning educator. She has taught tens of thousands
of students through her online courses on topics ranging from machine learning interpretability
to hyperparameter optimization. It's fantastic that she has taken on this timeless topic of feature
engineering. Her approach is direct, pragmatic, and practical. As the author of the popular Featureengine, a Python library for feature engineering, and a respected machine learning educator, Sole is
uniquely qualified to cover this topic.
The third edition of this book, which you have in your hands now, provides updated guidelines for
selecting methods based on the data and the model. It also covers the integration of scikit-learn with
pandas through the recently released set_output API. Finally, it covers automating feature creation
using decision trees.
Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this book will provide you with practical
insights, lots of code examples, and various techniques to improve your machine learning models
through effective feature engineering.
