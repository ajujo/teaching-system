Capturing the elapsed time between datetime variables
189
We see the first five rows of the DataFrame from Step 2 in the following output:
Figure 6.13 - The first five rows of a DataFrame with two datetime variables
3.
Let's capture the difference in days between the two variables in a new feature, and then display
the DataFrame's top rows:
df["elapsed_days"] = (
    df["date2"] - df["date1"]).dt.days
df.head()
We see the difference in days in the following output:
Figure 6.14 - Top rows of a DataFrame with a new variable capturing
the time difference between the two datetime features
4.
Let's capture the difference in weeks between the two datetime variables and then display
the DataFrame's top rows:
df["weeks_passed"] = (
    (df[«date2»] - df[«date1»]) / np.timedelta64(1, "W"))
df.head()
