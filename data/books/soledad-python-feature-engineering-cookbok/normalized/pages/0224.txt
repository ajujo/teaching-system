Automating the datetime feature extraction with Feature-engine

Let's create the new features:
dft = dfts.fit_transform(df)
DatetimeFeatures() will set all variables into UTC before deriving the features. With
dft.head(), we can see the resulting DataFrame:
Figure 6.23 - A DataFrame with the original and new variables
With that, we've created multiple date and time-related features in a few lines of code. featureengine offers a great alternative to manually creating features per feature with pandas. In addition,
DatetimeFeatures() can be integrated into scikit-learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV,
among other classes.
How it works...
DatetimeFeatures() extracts several date and time features from datetime variables
automatically by utilizing pandas' dt under the hood. It works with variables whose original data
types are datetime, as well as with object-like and categorical variables, provided that they can be
parsed into a datetime format.
DatetimeFeatures() extracts the following features by default: month, year, day_of_week,
day_of_month, hour, minute and second. We can make the transformer return all the features
it supports by setting the parameter features_to_extract to all. In addition, we can extract
a specific subset of features by passing the feature names in a list, as we did in Step 7.
DatetimeFeatures() automatically finds datetime variables or variables that can be parsed
as datetime in the DataFrame passed to the fit() method. To extract features from a selected
variable or group of variables, we can pass their name in a list to the variables parameter when
we set up the transformer.
