Figure 1.1: Common elements from an ML system
The preceding figure shows all the components the Google Cloud team suggests that a mature ML 
and MLOps system requires. Along with the ML code, there are many moving pieces. The rest of 
the system comprises configuration, automation, data collection, data verification, testing and 
debugging, resource management, model analysis, process and metadata management, serving 
infrastructure, and monitoring. The point is that there are many components we must consider 
when productionizing an ML model.
Thus, the critical question is this: How do we connect all these components into a single homog-
enous system? We must create a boilerplate for clearly designing ML systems to answer that 
question.
Similar solutions exist for classic software. For example, if you zoom out, most software appli-
cations can be split between a DB, business logic, and UI layer. Every layer can be as complex as 
needed, but at a high-level overview, the architecture of standard software can be boiled down 
to the previous three components.
Do we have something similar for ML applications? The first step is to examine previous solutions 
and why they are unsuitable for building scalable ML systems.
