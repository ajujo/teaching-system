Quick overview of GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform provided by GitHub that allows developers to automate their 
workflows directly within a GitHub repository. It enables users to build, test, and deploy their 
code directly from GitHub by defining workflows in YAML files. Since it’s part of GitHub, it works 
seamlessly with repositories, issues, PRs, and other GitHub features. Here are the key components 
you should know about:
•	
Workflows: A workflow is an automated process defined in a YAML file located in your 
repository’s .github/workflows directory. It specifies what should happen (e.g., build, 
test, and deploy) and when (e.g., on push, on PR).
•	
Jobs: Workflows are made up of jobs, which are groups of steps that execute on the same 
runner. Each job runs in its own virtual environment.
•	
Steps: Jobs are made up of multiple independent steps, which can be actions or shell 
commands.
•	
Actions: Actions are reusable commands or scripts. You can use pre-built actions from 
GitHub Marketplace or create your own. You can think of them as Python functions.
•	
Runners: Runners are the servers that run your jobs. GitHub provides hosted runners 
(Linux, Windows, macOS), or you can even self-host your runners.
A workflow is described using YAML syntax. For example, a simple workflow that clones the 
current GitHub repository and installs Python 3.11 on an Ubuntu machine looks like this:
name: Example
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Setup Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v3
           with:
               python-version: "3.11"
