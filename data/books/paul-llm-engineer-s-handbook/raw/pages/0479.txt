To keep the function light, we added all the logic up to computing the features. But, as we sug-
gested in the code snippet above, you can easily add the instruction dataset generation, training, 
and deploy logic to the parent pipeline to implement an end-to-end flow. By doing that, you can 
automate everything from data collection to deploying the model.
To run the end-to-end pipeline, use the following poe command:
poetry poe run-end-to-end-data-pipeline
What we implemented is not the best approach, as it compresses all the steps into a single monolith 
pipeline (which we want to avoid), as illustrated in Figure 11.20. Usually, you want to keep each 
pipeline isolated and use triggers to start downstream pipelines. This makes the system easier 
to understand, debug, and monitor.
