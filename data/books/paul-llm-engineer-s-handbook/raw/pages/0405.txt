Inference Pipeline Deployment
374
In this section, we will walk you through the code presented in Figure 10.5 that helps us fully auto-
mate the deployment process, starting with the create_endpoint() function. Ultimately, we will 
test the CLI command and check the AWS console to see whether the deployment was successful. 
The SageMaker deployment code is available at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineers-Handbook/tree/main/llm_engineering/infrastructure/aws/deploy.
