Instruction
You are a data quality evaluator. Your goal is to assess an instruction and its corresponding 
answer, determining how effectively the answer addresses the given task.
In your evaluation, you will provide feedback detailing the strengths and weaknesses of the 
answer, followed by a score on a scale of 1 to 4.
A score of 1 means that the answer is terrible and irrelevant to the instruction.
A score of 2 means that the answer is not helpful and misses important aspects of the 
instruction.
A score of 3 means that the answer is helpful but could be improved in terms of relevance, 
accuracy, and depth.
A score of 4 means that the answer is excellent and fully addresses the task.
Provide your evaluation as follows:
Feedback: (strengths and weaknesses you find relevant)
Score: (number between 1 and 4)
Table 5.2 – Example of LLM-as-a-judge prompt for data quality evaluation
LLM-as-a-judge is known to have several biases. First, it has a position bias in comparative scoring, 
where the LLM judge favors the first answer. This can be addressed by randomizing the order of 
answers A and B. In addition, like humans, LLM judges favor long answers. Length normaliza-
tion techniques can be applied to absolute scoring to mitigate this issue. Finally, LLM judges are 
known to have intra-model favoritism, meaning that they prefer models from the same family 
(GPT-4o with GPT-4 and GPT-4o mini, for example). This can be addressed by using several 
models instead of a single one.
