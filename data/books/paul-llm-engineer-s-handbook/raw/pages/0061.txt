Tooling and Installation
30
When working with Poe the Poet, instead of having all your commands documented in a README 
file or other document, you can add them directly to your pyproject.toml file and execute them 
in the command line with an alias. For example, using Poe the Poet, we can define the following 
tasks in a pyproject.toml file:
[tool.poe.tasks]
test = "pytest"
format = "black ."
start = "python main.py"
You can then run these tasks using the poe command:
poetry poe test
poetry poe format
poetry poe start
You can install Poe the Poet as a Poetry plugin, as follows:
poetry self add 'poethepoet[poetry_plugin]'
To conclude, using a tool as a façade over all your CLI commands is necessary to run your appli-
cation. It significantly simplifies the application’s complexity and enhances collaboration as it 
acts as out-of-the-box documentation.
Assuming you have pyenv and Poetry installed, here are all the commands you need to run to 
clone the repository and install the dependencies and Poe the Poet as a Poetry plugin:
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook.gitcd 
LLM-Engineers-Handbook
poetry install --without aws
poetry self add 'poethepoet[poetry_plugin]'
To make the project fully operational, there are still a few steps to follow, such as filling out a 
.env file with your credentials and getting tokens from OpenAI and Hugging Face. But this book 
isn’t an installation guide, so we’ve moved all these details into the repository’s README as 
they are useful only if you plan to run the repository: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/
LLM-Engineers-Handbook.
Now that we have installed our Python project, let’s present the MLOps tools we will use in the 
book. If you are already familiar with these tools, you can safely skip the following tooling section 
and move on to the Databases for storing unstructured and vector data section.
