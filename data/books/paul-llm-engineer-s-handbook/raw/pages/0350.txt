Figure 9.1: RAG inference pipeline architecture
The feature pipeline and the retrieval module, defined in Figure 9.1, are independent processes. The 
feature pipeline runs on a different machine on a schedule to populate the vector DB. At the same 
time, the retrieval module is called on demand, within the inference pipeline, on every user request.
