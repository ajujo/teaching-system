Figure 4.17: Handler class hierarchy and their interaction
Let’s examine each handler family and see how it is implemented.
The cleaning handlers
The CleaningDataHandler() strategy interface looks as follows:
… # Other imports.
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
DocumentT = TypeVar("DocumentT", bound=Document)
CleanedDocumentT = TypeVar("CleanedDocumentT", bound=CleanedDocument)
class CleaningDataHandler(ABC, Generic[DocumentT, CleanedDocumentT]):
The code for all the handlers is available on GitHub at https://github.com/
