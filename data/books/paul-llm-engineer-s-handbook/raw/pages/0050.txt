Data collection pipeline
The data collection pipeline involves crawling your personal data from Medium, Substack, Linke-
dIn, and GitHub. As a data pipeline, we will use the extract, load, transform (ETL) pattern to 
extract data from social media platforms, standardize it, and load it into a data warehouse.
The output of this component will be a NoSQL DB, which will act as our data warehouse. As we 
work with text data, which is naturally unstructured, a NoSQL DB fits like a glove.
Even though a NoSQL DB, such as MongoDB, is not labeled as a data warehouse, from our point 
of view, it will act as one. Why? Because it stores standardized raw data gathered by various ETL 
pipelines that are ready to be ingested into an ML system.
The collected digital data is binned into three categories:
•	
Articles (Medium, Substack)
•	
Posts (LinkedIn)
•	
Code (GitHub)
We want to abstract away the platform where the data was crawled. For example, when feeding 
an article to the LLM, knowing it came from Medium or Substack is not essential. We can keep 
the source URL as metadata to give references. However, from the processing, fine-tuning, and 
RAG points of view, it is vital to know what type of data we ingested, as each category must be 
processed differently. For example, the chunking strategy between a post, article, and piece of 
code will look different.
Also, by grouping the data by category, not the source, we can quickly plug data from other plat-
forms, such as X into the posts or GitLab into the code collection. As a modular system, we must 
attach an additional ETL in the data collection pipeline, and everything else will work without 
further code modifications.
Feature pipeline
The feature pipeline’s role is to take raw articles, posts, and code data points from the data ware-
house, process them, and load them into the feature store. 
It is critical to highlight that the data collection pipeline is designed to crawl data 
only from your social media platform. It will not have access to other people. As an 
example for this book, we agreed to make our collected data available for learning 
purposes. Otherwise, using other people’s data without their consent is not moral.
