RAG Feature Pipeline
134
In Figure 8.10, we compare what tools you can use based on your architecture (streaming versus 
batch) and the quantity of data you have to process (small versus big data). In our use case, we 
are in the smaller data and batch quadrant, where we picked a combination of vanilla Python and 
generative AI tools such as LangChain, Sentence Transformers, and Unstructured.

In the Change data capture: syncing the data warehouse and feature store section later in this chapter, 
we will discuss when switching from a batch architecture to a streaming one makes sense.
Core steps
Most of the RAG feature pipelines are composed of five core steps. The one implemented in the 
LLM Twin architecture makes no exception. Thus, you can quickly adapt this pattern for other 
RAG applications, but here is what the LLM Twin’s RAG feature pipeline looks like:

Data extraction: Extract the latest articles, code repositories, and posts from the Mon-
goDB data warehouse. At the extraction step, you usually aggregate all the data you need 
for processing.
