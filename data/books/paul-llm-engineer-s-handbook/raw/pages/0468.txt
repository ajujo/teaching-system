The first job, named QA, is responsible for quality assurance tasks like code checks and format-
ting verification. Within the qa job, the first step is to check out the repository’s code using the 
actions/checkout@v3 action. This step is necessary to ensure that the job has access to the code 
that needs to be analyzed.
jobs:
  qa:
    name: QA
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
The next step is to set up the Python environment. This is done using the actions/setup-python@
v3 action, with the Python version specified as "3.11". This step ensures that the subsequent 
steps in the job will run in the correct Python environment.
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
The workflow then installs Poetry using the abatilo/actions-poetry@v2 action, specifying the 
version of Poetry as 1.8.3:
      - name: Install poetry
        uses: abatilo/actions-poetry@v2
        with:
          poetry-version: 1.8.3
Once Poetry is set up, the workflow installs the project’s development dependencies using the 
poetry install --only dev command. Additionally, the workflow adds the poethepoet plugin 
for Poetry, which will be used to run predefined tasks more conveniently within the project.
      - name: Install packages
        run: |
          poetry install --only dev
          poetry self add 'poethepoet[poetry_plugin]'
