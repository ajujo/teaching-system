Now we have to add another tag to the llmtwin Docker image that signals the Docker registry 
we want to push it to:
docker tag llmtwin ${AWS_ECR_URL}:latest
Finally, we push it to ECR by running:
docker push ${AWS_ECR_URL}:latest
After the upload is finished, return to your AWS ECR dashboard and open your ZenML repository. 
The Docker image should appear, as shown here:
