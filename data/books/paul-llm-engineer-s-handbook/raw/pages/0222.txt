Several tools are available for performing topic clustering, each with its own strengths and ap-
proaches. For example, Hugging Face’s text-clustering provides a simple pipeline with sentence 
transformers for embedding text into vector space, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and 
DBSCAN for clustering. It also automatically labels clusters using an LLM and can output visu-
alizations. Nomic Atlas (see Figure 5.5), BunkaTopics, and Lilac are alternatives proposing similar 
approaches with additional features.
Data generation
When the available instruction datasets are not sufficient, creating custom data becomes necessary. 
This is particularly relevant for specialized applications where publicly available data is scarce.
