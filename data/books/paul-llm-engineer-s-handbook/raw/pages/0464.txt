If any check fails, the CI pipeline fails, and the developer who created the PR cannot merge it into 
the staging branch until it fixes the issues.
Implementing a CI pipeline ensures that new features follow the repository’s standards and 
don’t break existing functionality. The exact process repeats when we plan to merge the staging 
branch into the production one. We open a PR, and the CI pipeline is automatically executed 
before merging the staging branch into production.
Figure 11.14: CI/CD pipelines flow
The CD pipeline runs after the branch is merged. For example, after the feature branch is merged 
into staging, the CD pipeline takes the code from the staging branch, builds a new Docker im-
age, and pushes it to the AWS ECR Docker repository. When running future pipeline runs in 
the staging environment, it will use the latest Docker image that was built by the CD pipeline. 
The exact process happens between staging and production. Still, the key difference is that the 
staging environment exists as an experimental place where the QA team and stakeholders can 
further manually test the new feature along with what is automatically tested in the CI pipeline.
