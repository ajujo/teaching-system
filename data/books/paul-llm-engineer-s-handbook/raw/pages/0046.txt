Benefits of the FTI architecture
To conclude, the most important thing you must remember about the FTI pipelines is their in-
terface:
•	
The feature pipeline takes in data and outputs the features and labels saved to the feature 
store.
•	
The training pipeline queries the features store for features and labels and outputs a 
model to the model registry.
•	
The inference pipeline uses the features from the feature store and the model from the 
model registry to make predictions.
It doesn’t matter how complex your ML system gets, these interfaces will remain the same.
Now that we understand better how the pattern works, we want to highlight the main benefits 
of using this pattern:
•	
As you have just three components, it is intuitive to use and easy to understand.
•	
Each component can be written into its tech stack, so we can quickly adapt them to specific 
needs, such as big or streaming data. Also, it allows us to pick the best tools for the job.
•	
As there is a transparent interface between the three components, each one can be de-
veloped by a different team (if necessary), making the development more manageable 
and scalable.
•	
Every component can be deployed, scaled, and monitored independently.
The final thing you must understand about the FTI pattern is that the system doesn’t have to 
contain only three pipelines. In most cases, it will include more. For example, the feature pipeline 
can be composed of a service that computes the features and one that validates the data. Also, the 
training pipeline can be composed of the training and evaluation components.
The FTI pipelines act as logical layers. Thus, it is perfectly fine for each to be complex and contain 
multiple services. However, what is essential is to stick to the same interface on how the FTI pipe-
lines interact with each other through the feature store and model registries. By doing so, each 
FTI component can evolve differently, without knowing the details of each other and without 
breaking the system on new changes.
