5. Monitoring
Monitoring is vital for any ML system that reaches production. Traditional software systems are 
rule-based and deterministic. Thus, once it is built, it will always work as defined. Unfortunate-
ly, that is not the case with ML systems. When implementing ML models, we haven’t explicitly 
described how they should work. We have used data to compile a probabilistic solution, which 
means that our ML model will constantly be exposed to a level of degradation. This happens 
because the data from production might differ from the data the model was trained on. Thus, it 
is natural that the shipped model doesn’t know how to handle these scenarios.
We shouldn’t try to avoid these situations but create a strategy to catch and fix these errors in time. 
Intuitively, monitoring detects the model’s performance degradation, which triggers an alarm that 
signals that the model should be retrained manually, automatically, or with a combination of both.
Why retrain the model? As the model performance degrades due to a drift in the training dataset 
and what it inputs from production, the only solution is to adapt or retrain the model on a new 
dataset that captures all the new scenarios from production.
As training is a costly operation, there are some tricks that you can perform to avoid retraining, 
but before describing them, let’s quickly understand what we can monitor to understand our 
ML system’s health.
Logs
The approach to logging is straightforward, which is to capture everything, such as:
•	
Document the system configurations.
•	
Record the query, the results, and any intermediate outputs.
•	
Log when a component begins, ends, crashes, and so on.
•	
Ensure that each log entry is tagged and identified in a way that clarifies its origin within 
the system.
While capturing all activities can rapidly increase the volume of logs, you can take advantage of 
numerous tools for automated log analysis and anomaly detection that leverage AI to efficiently 
scan all the logs, providing you with the confidence to manage the logs effectively.
Metrics
To quantify your application’s healthiness, you must define a set of metrics. Each metric measures 
different aspects of your application, such as the infrastructure, data, and model.
