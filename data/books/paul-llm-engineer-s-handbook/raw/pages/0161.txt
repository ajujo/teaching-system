Batch pipelines
A batch pipeline in data systems refers to a data processing method where data is collected, pro-
cessed, and stored in predefined intervals and larger volumes, also known as “batches”. This ap-
proach differs from real-time or streaming data processing, where data is processed continuously 
as it arrives. This is what happens in a batch pipeline:
1.	
Data collection: Data is collected from various sources and stored until sufficient amounts 
are accumulated for processing. This can include data from DBs, logs, files, and other 
sources.
2.	
Scheduled processing: Data processing is scheduled at regular intervals, for example, 
hourly or daily. During this time, the collected data is processed in bulk. This can involve 
data cleansing, transformation, aggregation, and other operations.
3.	
Data loading: After processing, the data is loaded into the target system, such as a DB, data 
warehouse, data lake, or feature store. This processed data is then available for analysis, 
querying, or further processing.
Batch pipelines are particularly useful when dealing with large volumes of data that do not require 
immediate processing. They offer several advantages, including:
•	
Efficiency: Batch processing can handle large volumes of data more efficiently than re-
al-time processing, allowing for optimized resource allocation and parallel processing.
•	
Complex processing: Batch pipelines can perform complex data transformations and 
aggregations that might be too resource-intensive for real-time processing.
•	
Simplicity: Batch processing systems’ architectures are often simpler than those of re-
al-time systems, making them easier to implement and maintain.
Batch versus streaming pipelines
When implementing feature pipelines, you have two main design choices: batch and streaming. 
Thus, it is worthwhile to see the difference between the two and understand why we chose a 
batch architecture over a streaming one for our LLM Twin use case.
You can effortlessly write a dedicated chapter on streaming pipelines, which suggests its com-
plexity over a batch design. However, as streaming architectures become increasingly popular, 
one must have an intuition of how they work to choose the best option for your application.
