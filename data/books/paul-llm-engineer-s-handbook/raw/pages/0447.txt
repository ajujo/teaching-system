Now, we can trigger any pipeline implemented during this book either from the CLI of 
our local machine or ZenML’s dashboard.
4.	
Each step from ZenML’s pipeline will be mapped to a SageMaker job that runs on an AWS 
EC2 virtual machine (VM). Based on the dependencies between the directed acyclic 
graph (DAG) steps, some will run in parallel and others sequentially.
5.	
When running a step, SageMaker pulls the Docker image from ECR, defined in step 2. 
Based on the pulled image, it creates a Docker container that executes the pipeline step.
6.	 As the job is executed, it can access the S3 artifact storage, MongoDB, and Qdrant vector 
DB to query or push data. The ZenML dashboard is a key tool, providing real-time updates 
on the pipeline’s progress and ensuring a clear view of the process.
Now that we know how the infrastructure works, let’s start by setting up MongoDB, Qdrant, and 
the ZenML cloud.
Setting up MongoDB
We will show you how to create and integrate a free MongoDB cluster into our projects. To do so, 
these are the steps you have to follow:
1.	
Go to their site at https://www.mongodb.com and create an account.
2.	
In the left panel, go to Deployment | Database and click Build a Cluster.
3.	
Within the creation form, do the following:
a.	
Choose an M0 Free cluster.
b.	 Call your cluster twin.
c.	
Choose AWS as your provider.
What AWS cloud region should I choose?
In our tutorials, all the services will be deployed to AWS within the Frankfurt 
(eu-central-1) region. You can select another region, but be consistent across all the 
services to ensure faster responses between components and reduce potential errors.
How should I manage changes in the services’ UIs?
Unfortunately, MongoDB, Qdrant, or other services may change their UI or naming 
conventions. As we can’t update this book each time that happens, please refer to 
their official documentation to check anything that differs from our tutorial. We 
apologize for this inconvenience, but unfortunately, it is not in our control.
