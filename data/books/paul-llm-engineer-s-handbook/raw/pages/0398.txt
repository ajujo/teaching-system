The LLM microservice is strictly optimized for the RAG generation component. Ultimately, the 
business layer will send the prompt trace consisting of the user query, prompt, answer, and other 
intermediary steps to the prompt monitoring pipeline, which we will detail in Chapter 11.
In summary, our approach involves implementing an online real-time ML service using a micro-
service architecture, which effectively splits the LLM and business logic into two distinct services.
