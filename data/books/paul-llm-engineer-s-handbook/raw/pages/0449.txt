Fill out the cluster creation form with the following:
a.	
Choose the Free version of the cluster.

c.	
Choose Frankfurt as the region (or the same region as you chose for MongoDB).
d.	 Name the cluster twin.
e.	
Leave the rest of the attributes with their default values and click Create.
4.	
Access the cluster in the Data Access Control section in the left panel.
5.

You can run their example from Usage Examples to test that your connection works fine.

Go back to the Clusters section of Qdrant and open your newly created twin cluster. You 
will have access to the cluster’s endpoint, which you need to configure Qdrant in your code.
You can visualize your Qdrant collections and documents by clicking Open Dashboard and en-
tering your API Key as your password. The Qdrant cluster dashboard will now be empty, but after 
running the pipelines, you will see all the collections, as shown here:
Figure 11.6: Qdrant cluster dashboard example after being populated with two collections.
Finally, return to your project and open your .env file. Now, we must fill in a couple of environ-
ment variables as follows:
USE_QDRANT_CLOUD=true
QDRANT_CLOUD_URL=<the endpoint URL found at step 7>
QDRANT_APIKEY=<the access token created at step 5>
