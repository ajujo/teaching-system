Tooling and Installation

By clicking on the crawled_links artifact and navigating to the Metadata tab, we can quickly 
see all the domains we crawled for a particular author, the number of links we crawled for each 
domain, and how many were successful, as illustrated in Figure 2.8:

A more interesting example of an artifact and its metadata is the generated dataset artifact. In 
Figure 2.9, we can visualize the metadata of the instruct_datasets artifact, which was auto-
matically generated and will be used to fine-tune the LLM Twin model. More details on the 
instruction datasets are in Chapter 5. For now, we want to highlight that within the dataset’s 
metadata, we have precomputed a lot of helpful information about it, such as how many data 
categories it contains, its storage size, and the number of samples per training and testing split.
