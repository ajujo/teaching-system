That’s it! Instead of reading and writing from your local Qdrant vector DB, you will do it from the 
cloud Qdrant cluster we just created. Just to be sure that everything works fine, run the end-to-
end data pipeline with the cloud version of MongoDB and Qdrant as follows:
peotry poe run-end-to-end-data-pipeline
The last step is setting up the ZenML cloud and deploying all our infrastructure to AWS.
Setting up the ZenML cloud
Setting up the ZenML cloud and the AWS infrastructure is a multi-step process. First, we will set 
up a ZenML cloud account, then the AWS infrastructure through the ZenML cloud, and, finally, 
we will bundle our code in a Docker image to run it in AWS SageMaker.
Let’s start with setting up the ZenML cloud:
1.	
Go to the ZenML cloud at https://cloud.zenml.io and make an account. They provide 
a seven-day free trial, which is enough to run our examples.
2.	
Fill out their onboarding form and create an organization with a unique name and a tenant 
called twin. A tenant refers to a deployment of ZenML in a fully isolated environment. 
Wait a few minutes until your tenant server is up before proceeding to the next step.
3.	
If you want to, you can go through their Quickstart Guide to understand how the ZenML 
cloud works with a simpler example. It is not required to go through it to deploy the LLM 
Twin application, but we recommend it to ensure everything works fine.
4.	
At this point, we assume that you have gone through the Quickstart Guide. Otherwise, 
you might encounter issues during the next steps. To connect our project with this Zen-
ML cloud tenant, return to the project and run the zenml connect command provided 
in the dashboard. It looks similar to the following example but with a different URL: 
zenml connect --url https://0c37a553-zenml.cloudinfra.zenml.io.
5.	
To ensure everything works fine, run a random pipeline from your code. Note that at this 
point, we are still running it locally, but instead of logging the results to the local server, 
we log everything to the cloud version:
poetry poe run-digital-data-etl
6.	
Go to the Pipelines section in the left panel of the ZenML dashboard. If everything worked 
fine, you should see the pipeline you ran in Step 5 there.
