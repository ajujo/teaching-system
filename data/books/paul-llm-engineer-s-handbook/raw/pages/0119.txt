The Document class is introduced as an abstract base model for other documents on top of the 
NoSQLBaseDocument ODM class. It includes common attributes like content, platform, and author 
details, providing a standardized structure for documents that will inherit from it:
class Document(NoSQLBaseDocument, ABC):
    content: dict
    platform: str
    author_id: UUID4 = Field(alias="author_id")
    author_full_name: str = Field(alias="author_full_name")
Finally, specific document types are defined by extending the Document class. The 
RepositoryDocument, PostDocument, and ArticleDocument classes represent different catego-
ries of data, each with unique fields and settings that specify their respective collection names 
in the database:
class RepositoryDocument(Document):
    name: str
    link: str
    class Settings:
        name = DataCategory.REPOSITORIES
class PostDocument(Document):
    image: Optional[str] = None
    link: str | None = None
    class Settings:
        name = DataCategory.POSTS
