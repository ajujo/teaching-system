responses with human expectations, thereby improving its accuracy 
and relevance. The goal is to ensure that the model can respond 
effectively to a wide range of queries, making it a valuable tool 
for applications such as chatbots and virtual assistants.
This is correct and properly formatted with the Alpaca chat template.
12.	 Now that our model has been successfully fine-tuned, we can save it locally and/or push 
it to the Hugging Face Hub using the following functions.
model.save_pretrained_merged("model", tokenizer, save_
method="merged_16bit")
model.push_to_hub_merged("mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-8B", tokenizer, 
save_method="merged_16bit")
Congratulations on fine-tuning a base model from scratch! During training, you can access Comet 
ML to monitor your training loss, validation loss, and many other metrics. You want to make sure 
that these metrics correspond to what is expected. Figure 5.11 shows the training run correspond-
ing to the previous code in Comet ML.
