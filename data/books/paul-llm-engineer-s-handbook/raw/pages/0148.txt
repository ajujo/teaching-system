Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of DB performance, including query latency and re-
source usage (RAM, CPU, disk), helps maintain optimal operations and identify potential 
issues before they impact the system.
•	
Access control: Implementing robust access control mechanisms ensures that only au-
thorized users can access and modify data. This includes role-based access controls and 
other security protocols to protect sensitive information.
•	
Backups: Regular DB backups are critical for disaster recovery. Automated backup pro-
cesses ensure that data can be restored to a previous state in case of corruption or loss.
An overview of advanced RAG
The vanilla RAG framework we just presented doesn’t address many fundamental aspects that 
impact the quality of the retrieval and answer generation, such as:
•	
Are the retrieved documents relevant to the user’s question?
•	
Is the retrieved context enough to answer the user’s question?
•	
Is there any redundant information that only adds noise to the augmented prompt?
•	
Does the latency of the retrieval step match our requirements?
•	
What do we do if we can’t generate a valid answer using the retrieved information?
From the questions above, we can draw two conclusions. The first one is that we need a robust 
evaluation module for our RAG system that can quantify and measure the quality of the retrieved 
data and generate answers relative to the user’s question. We will discuss this topic in more detail 
in Chapter 9. The second conclusion is that we must improve our RAG framework to address the 
retrieval limitations directly in the algorithm. These improvements are known as advanced RAG.
The vanilla RAG design can be optimized at three different stages:
•	
Pre-retrieval: This stage focuses on how to structure and preprocess your data for data 
indexing optimizations as well as query optimizations.
•	
Retrieval: This stage revolves around improving the embedding models and metadata 
filtering to improve the vector search step.
