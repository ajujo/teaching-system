Instructions must be self-contained and general. \
Answers must imitate the writing style of the context. \
Example instruction: Explain the concept of an LLM Twin. \
Example answer: An LLM Twin is essentially an AI character that 
mimics your writing style, personality, and voice. \
It's designed to write just like you by incorporating these elements 
into a language model. \
The idea is to create a digital replica of your writing habits using 
advanced AI techniques. \
Provide your response in JSON format with the following structure:
{{
    "instruction_answer_pairs": [
        {{"instruction": "...", "answer": "..."}},
        ...
    ]
}}
Extract:

8.	 In addition to the user prompt, we can also specify a system prompt to guide the mod-
el into generating the expected instructions. Here, we repeat our high-level task in the 
system prompt.
The concatenation of the system and user prompts is fed to the OpenAI API, using the GPT-
4o mini model in JSON mode and a maximum of 1,200 tokens in the answer. We also use a 
standard temperature of 0.7 to encourage diverse responses. The generated text is directly 
parsed using the InstructionAnswerSet class to return pairs of instructions and answers.
