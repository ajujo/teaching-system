ZenML uses, by default, ml.t3.medium EC2 machines, which are part of the AWS freemium tier. 
However, some AWS accounts cannot access these VMs by default. To check your access, search 
your AWS console for Service Quotas. Then, in the left panel, click on AWS services, search for 
Amazon SageMaker, and then for ml.t3.medium. In Figure 11.13, you can see our quotas for these 
types of machines. If yours is 0, you should request that AWS increase them to numbers similar 
to those from Figure 11.13 in the Applied account-level quota value column. The whole process 
is free of charge and only requires a few clicks. Unfortunately, you might have to wait for a few 
hours up to one day until AWS accepts your request.

You can find step-by-step instructions on how to solve this error and request new quotas at this

If you changed the values from your .env file and want to update the ZenML secrets 
with them, first run the following CLI command to delete the old secrets:
poetry poe delete-settings-zenml
Then, you can export them again by running:
poetry poe export-settings-to-zenml
