Another aspect of data decontamination is filtering out samples that may have been derived from 
the same source as evaluation data. This can involve checking for overlapping phrases, similar 
sentence structures, or common metadata. Practitioners may also use provenance tracking (source 
the data they use) to identify and exclude data from specific sources that are known to be used 
in evaluation sets.
Data quality evaluation
Data quality evaluation is a critical aspect of machine learning, particularly for LLMs. The process 
involves assessing various characteristics of datasets, including accuracy, diversity, and complexity. 
While some aspects like mathematical accuracy can be easily verified using tools such as Python 
interpreters, evaluating subjective or open-ended content remains challenging.
Traditional methods of data quality assessment include human annotation, which generally 
provides high accuracy but is resource-intensive. To address scalability issues, machine learning 
techniques have been developed to automate the evaluation process. These include using LLMs 
as judges, reward models, and classifiers trained for quality prediction.
The LLM-as-a-judge strategy involves prompting LLMs to evaluate the quality of each sample. 
This approach has become popular due to its flexibility and ease of use, though it does present 
some challenges. Different LLMs have different levels of performance across tasks, and their 
evaluations often align more closely with those of non-experts. With domain-specific datasets, 
you might want to use domain-specific models instead of better, general-purpose LLMs. Com-
parative assessment methods (e.g., “Is answer A better than answer B?”) generally outperform 
absolute scoring approaches (e.g., “Rate answer A between 1 and 4”), though both can be used 
at scale with sufficient prompt engineering. We recommend iterating through different prompts 
over a representative subset to manually verify the quality of the responses. Table 5.2 shows an 
example of a custom prompt for a judge LLM.
