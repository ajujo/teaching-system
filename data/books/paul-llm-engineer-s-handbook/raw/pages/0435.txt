MLOps and LLMOps
404
In ML systems, a build can be triggered by any change in these areas—whether it’s an update in 
the code, modifications in the data, or adjustments to the model.

In DevOps, everything is centered around the code. For example, when a new feature is added to 
the codebase, you have to trigger the CI/CD pipeline. In MLOps, the code can remain unchanged 
while only the data changes. In that case, you must train (or fine-tune) a new model, resulting 
in a new dataset and model version. Intuitively, when one component changes, it affects one or 
more of the others. Thus, MLOps has to take into consideration all this extra complexity. Here are 
a few examples that can trigger a change in the data and indirectly in the model:
•	
After deploying the ML model, its performance might decay as time passes, so we need 
new data to retrain it.
•	
After understanding how to collect data in the real world, we might recognize that getting 
the data for our problem is challenging, so we need to re-formulate it to work with our 
real-world setup.
•	
While in the experimentation stage and training the model, we often must collect more 
data or re-label it, which generates a new set of models.
