Supervised Fine-Tuning

Due to the small size of the dataset, there is no need for comprehensive exploration and topic 
clustering.

As seen in the previous section, we could refine this instruction dataset by increasing the diver-
sity and complexity of our samples. More advanced prompt engineering could also increase the 
quality of the generated data by providing examples of the expected results, for instance. Finally, 
quality evaluation could help filter out low-quality samples by reviewing them individually. For 
conciseness and simplicity, we will keep a straightforward approach for this instruction dataset 
and explore more advanced methods in Chapter 6 when we create a preference dataset.
In the next section, we will introduce SFT techniques, as well as related concepts.
Exploring SFT and its techniques
SFT consists of re-training pre-trained models on a smaller dataset composed of pairs of instruc-
tions and answers. The goal of SFT is to turn a base model, which can only perform next-token 
prediction, into a useful assistant, capable of answering questions and following instructions. 
SFT can also be used to improve the general performance of the base model (general-purpose 
SFT), instill new knowledge (e.g., new languages, domains, etc.), focus on specific tasks, adopt 
a particular voice, and so on.
In this section, we will discuss when to use fine-tuning and explore related concepts with storage 
formats and chat templates. Finally, we will introduce three popular ways of implementing SFT: 
full-finetuning, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adaptation 
(QLoRA).
