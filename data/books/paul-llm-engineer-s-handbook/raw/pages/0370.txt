Implementing the retrieval module
Let’s dive into the ContextRetriever class implementation, which orchestrates the retrieval 
step in our RAG system by integrating all the advanced techniques we previously used: que-
ry expansion, self-querying, reranking, and filtered vector search. The class can be found on 
GitHub at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook/blob/main/llm_
engineering/application/rag/retriever.py.
