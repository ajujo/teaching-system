ML vs. MLOps engineering
There is a fine line between ML engineering and MLOps. If we want to define a rigid job description 
for the two rules, it cannot be easy to completely differentiate what responsibilities go into ML 
engineering (MLE) and what goes into MLOps. I have seen many job roles that bucket the MLOps 
role with the platform and cloud engineers. From one perspective, that makes a lot of sense: as 
an MLOps engineer, you have a lot of work to do on the infrastructure side. On the other hand, as 
seen in this section, an MLOps engineer still has to implement things such as experiment tracking, 
model registries, versioning, and more. A good strategy would be to let the ML engineer integrate 
these into the code and the MLOps engineer focus on making them work on their infrastructure.
At a big corporation, ultimately, differentiating the two roles might make sense. But when work-
ing in small to medium-sized teams, you will wear multiple hats and probably work on the ML 
system’s MLE and MLOps aspects.
Figure 11.3: DS vs. MLE vs. MLOps
For instance, in Figure 11.3, we see a clear division of responsibilities among the three key roles: 
data scientist/ML researcher, ML engineer, and MLOps engineer. The Data Scientist (DS) imple-
ments specific models to address problems.
