More on formatting errors
Formatting errors relate to the style and structure of your code, ensuring that it adheres to a 
consistent visual layout. This can include the placement of spaces, indentation, line length, and 
other stylistic elements.
The main purpose of formatting is to make your code more readable and maintainable. Consistent 
formatting helps teams work together more effectively, as the code looks uniform, regardless of 
who wrote it. Examples of formatting errors are:
•	
Incorrect indentation (e.g., mixing spaces and tabs)
•	
Lines that are too long (e.g., exceeding 79 or 88 characters, depending on your style guide)
•	
Missing or extra spaces around operators or after commas
More on linting errors
Linting errors relate to potential issues in your code that could lead to bugs, inefficiencies, or 
non-adherence to coding standards beyond just style. Linting checks often involve static analysis 
of the code to catch things like unused variables, undefined names, or questionable practices.
Linting’s main goal is to catch potential errors or bad practices early in the development process, 
improving code quality and reducing the likelihood of bugs. Examples of linting errors are:
•	
Unused imports or variables
•	
Undefined variables or functions are being used
•	
Potentially dangerous code (e.g., using == instead of is for checking against None)
We use Ruff, a versatile tool for formatting and linting. It incorporates checks for common for-
matting issues and PEP 8 compliance, as well as deeper linting checks for potential errors and 
code quality problems. Also, it is written in Rust, making it fast for big codebases.
Before implementing what we’ve explained above, let’s examine the core principles of GitHub 
Actions.
In our repository, we used only a main branch, which reflects production, and fea-
ture branches to push new work. We did this to keep things simple, but the same 
principles apply. To extend the flow, you must create a staging branch and add it 
to the CD pipeline.
