Figure 8.12 shows the DAG of the RAG feature pipeline, where you can follow all the pipeline steps 
and their output artifacts. Remember that whatever is returned from a ZenML step is automati-
cally saved as an artifact, stored in ZenML’s artifact registry, versioned, and shareable across the 
application.
