3.	
Build: Package your applications and dependencies into an executable format.
4.	
Test: This stage is crucial. It’s where you confirm that your code functions correctly and 
meets quality standards, ideally through automated testing.
5.	
Release: If the tests pass, flag the tested build as a new release, which is now ready to be 
shipped.
6.	
Deploy: Deploy the latest release to the end users.
7.	
Operate: Manage and maintain the infrastructure on which the software runs effectively 
once it is live. This involves scaling, security, data management, and backup and recovery.
8.	 Monitor: Track performance metrics and errors to reduce the severity and frequency of 
incidents.

The core DevOps concepts
DevOps encompasses various practices throughout the application lifecycle, but the core ones 
that we will touch on throughout this book are:
•	
Deployment environments: To thoroughly test your code before shipping it to produc-
tion, you must define multiple pre-production environments that mimic the production 
one. The most common approach is to create a dev environment where the developers 
can test their latest features. Then, you have a staging environment where the QA team 
and stakeholders tinker with the application to find bugs and experience the latest fea-
tures before they ship to the users. Lastly, we have the production environment, which 
is exposed to end users.
