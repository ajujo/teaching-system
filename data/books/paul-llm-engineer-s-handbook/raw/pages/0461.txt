To find even more details about the runs, you can go to AWS SageMaker. In the left panel, click 
SageMaker dashboard, and on the right, in the Processing column, click on the green Running

This will open a list of all the processing jobs that execute your ZenML pipelines.

Troubleshooting the ResourceLimitExceeded error after running 
a ZenML pipeline on SageMaker
Let’s assume, you’ve encountered a ResourceLimitExceeded error after running a ZenML pipeline 
on SageMaker using the AWS stack. In this case, you have to explicitly ask AWS to give you access 
to a specific type of AWS EC2 VM.
To run other pipelines, you have to update the settings.docker.parent_image 
attribute in their config file under the configs/ directory.
If you want to run the pipelines locally again, use the following CLI command:
poetry poe set-local-stack
If you want to disconnect from the ZenML cloud dashboard and use the local version 
again, run the following:
zenml disconnect
