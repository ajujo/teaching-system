Using this configuration, we always have four replicas serving the clients, regardless of idle time 
or spikes in traffic. The solution is to implement an autoscaling strategy that scales the number 
of replicas up and down dynamically based on various metrics, such as the number of requests.
For example, Figure 10.8 shows a standard architecture where the SageMaker Inference endpoints 
scale in and out based on the number of requests. When there is no traffic, we can have one online 
replica so the server remains responsive to new user requests or even scales down to zero if the 
latency is not super critical. Then, let’s assume that when we have around 10 requests per second, 
we have to keep two replicas online, and when the number of requests spikes to 100 per second, 
the autoscaling service should spin up to 20 replicas to keep up with the demand. Note that these 
are fictional numbers that should be adapted to your specific use case.
