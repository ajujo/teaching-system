Figure 8.9 – Comparison the between FP32, FP16, and BF16 formats
A sign of 0 represents a positive number, while 1 indicates a negative number. Conversely, the 
exponent controls the range that is represented (big or small). Finally, the significand controls 
the precision of the number (the number of digits). The formula used to convert these represen-
tations into real numbers is:
(−1)sign × baseexponent × significand
The data types shown in Figure 7.7 display different tradeoffs, as illustrated with different repre-
sentations of 𝜋𝜋 (≈3.1415926535). FP32 uses 32 bits, providing high precision but also requiring more 
memory. Conversely, FP16 and BF16 use 16 bits, lowering the memory footprint at the cost of a 
lower precision. In general, neural networks prefer a bigger range than better precision, which is 
why BF16 is the most popular data type when the hardware supports it. For example, NVIDIA’s 
Ampere architecture (A100, A30, etc.) supports BF16, but previous generations like Turing (T4, 
T40, etc.) do not.
