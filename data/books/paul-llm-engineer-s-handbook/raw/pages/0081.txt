For more details on how to configure the AWS CLI, check out the following tutorial: https://
docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html.
Also, to configure the project with your AWS credentials, you must fill in the following variables 
within your .env file:

SageMaker: training and inference compute
The last topic of this chapter is understanding SageMaker and why we decided to use it. SageMaker 
is an ML platform used to train and deploy ML models. An official definition is as follows: AWS 
SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service by AWS that enables developers and data 
scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. It simplifies the process 
by handling the underlying infrastructure, allowing users to focus on developing high-quality 
models efficiently.
An important note about costs associated with hands-on tasks in this book
All the cloud services used across the book stick to their freemium option, except AWS. 
Thus, if you use a personal AWS account, you will be responsible for AWS costs as you 
follow along in this book. While some services may fall under AWS Free Tier usage, 
others will not. Thus, you are responsible for checking your billing console regularly.
Most of the costs will come when testing SageMaker for training and inference. Based 
on our tests, the AWS costs can vary between $50 and $100 using the specifications 
provided in this book and repository.
See the AWS documentation on setting up billing alarms to monitor your costs 
at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/
monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html.
