The UltraFeedback method is another innovative approach, focused on answer quality instead 
of instruction quality. It employs AI feedback to enhance the quality and diversity of model re-
sponses. Unlike Evol-Instruct, which evolves instructions, UltraFeedback uses a large pool of 
diverse instructions and models to generate a wide range of responses.
