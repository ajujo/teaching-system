Tooling and Installation
This chapter presents all the essential tools that will be used throughout the book, especially in 
implementing and deploying the LLM Twin project. At this point in the book, we don’t plan to 
present in-depth LLM, RAG, MLOps, or LLMOps concepts. We will quickly walk you through our 
tech stack and prerequisites to avoid repeating ourselves throughout the book on how to set up 
a particular tool and why we chose it. Starting with Chapter 3, we will begin exploring our LLM 
Twin use case by implementing a data collection ETL that crawls data from the internet.
In the first part of the chapter, we will present the tools within the Python ecosystem to manage 
multiple Python versions, create a virtual environment, and install the pinned dependencies re-
quired for our project to run. Alongside presenting these tools, we will also show how to install 
the LLM-Engineers-Handbook repository on your local machine (in case you want to try out the 
code yourself): https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook.
Next, we will explore all the MLOps and LLMOps tools we will use, starting with more generic tools, 
such as a model registry, and moving on to more LLM-oriented tools, such as LLM evaluation and 
prompt monitoring tools. We will also understand how to manage a project with multiple ML 
pipelines using ZenML, an orchestrator bridging the gap between ML and MLOps. Also, we will 
quickly explore what databases we will use for NoSQL and vector storage. We will show you how 
to run all these components on your local machine using Docker. Lastly, we will quickly review 
AWS and show you how to create an AWS user and access keys and install and configure the AWS 
CLI to manipulate your cloud resources programmatically. We will also explore SageMaker and 
why we use it to train and deploy our open-source LLMs.
