For example, you can use UMAP (https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.
html), a dimensionality reduction method well known for keeping the geometrical properties 
between the points when projecting the embeddings to 2D or 3D. Another popular algorithm for 
dimensionality reduction when visualizing vectors is t-SNE (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html). However, compared to UMAP, it is more 
stochastic and doesn’t preserve the topological relationships between the points.

 A dimensionality reduction algorithm, such as PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE, is a mathe-
matical technique used to reduce the number of input variables or features in a data-
set while preserving the data’s essential patterns, structure, and relationships. The 
goal is to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form, making 
it easier to visualize, interpret, and process while minimizing the loss of important 
information. These methods help to address the “curse of dimensionality,” improve 
computational efficiency, and often enhance the performance of ML algorithms.
