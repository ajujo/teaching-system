Post-processing results: After identifying potential matches, the results undergo post-pro-
cessing to refine accuracy. This step ensures that the most relevant vectors are returned 
to the user.
Vector DBs can filter results based on metadata before or after the vector search. Both approaches 
have trade-offs in terms of performance and accuracy. The query also depends on the metadata 
(along with the vector index), so it contains a metadata index user for filtering operations.
Algorithms for creating the vector index
Vector DBs use various algorithms to create the vector index and manage searching data efficiently:
•	
Random projection: Random projection reduces the dimensionality of vectors by project-
ing them into a lower-dimensional space using a random matrix. This technique preserves 
the relative distances between vectors, facilitating faster searches.
•	
PQ: PQ compresses vectors by dividing them into smaller sub-vectors and then quantizing 
these sub-vectors into representative codes. This reduces memory usage and speeds up 
similarity searches.
•	
LSH: LSH maps similar vectors into buckets. This method enables fast approximate near-
est neighbor searches by focusing on a subset of the data, reducing the computational 
complexity.
•	
HNSW: HNSW constructs a multi-layer graph where each node represents a set of vectors. 
Similar nodes are connected, allowing the algorithm to navigate the graph and find the 
nearest neighbors efficiently.
These algorithms enable vector DBs to efficiently handle complex and large-scale data, making 
them a perfect fit for a variety of AI and ML applications.
DB operations
Vector DBs also share common characteristics with standard DBs to ensure high performance, 
fault tolerance, and ease of management in production environments. Key operations include:
•	
Sharding and replication: Data is partitioned (sharded) across multiple nodes to ensure 
scalability and high availability. Data replication across nodes helps maintain data integ-
rity and availability in case of node failures.
