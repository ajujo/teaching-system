After running the CLI command from above, you will have a one-to-one replica of the dataset 
we used while developing the code. To ensure the import is completed successfully, you should 
have 88 articles and 3 users in your MongoDB database.
Summary
In this chapter, we’ve learned how to design and build the data collection pipeline for the LLM 
Twin use case. Instead of relying on static datasets, we collected our custom data to mimic re-
al-world situations, preparing us for real-world challenges in building AI systems.
First, we examined the architecture of LLM Twin’s data collection pipeline, which functions 
as an ETL process. Next, we started digging into the pipeline implementation. We began by 
understanding how we can orchestrate the pipeline using ZenML. Then, we looked into the 
crawler implementation. We learned how to crawl data in three ways: using CLI commands in 
subprocesses or using utility functions from LangChain or Selenium to build custom logic that 
programmatically manipulates the browser. Finally, we looked into how to build our own ODM 
class, which we used to define our document class hierarchy, which contains entities such as 
articles, posts, and repositories.
At the end of the chapter, we learned how to run ZenML pipelines with different YAML configura-
tion files and explore the results in the dashboard. We also saw how to interact with the MongoDB 
data warehouse through the ODM classes.
In the next chapter, we will cover the key steps of the RAG feature pipeline, including chunking 
and embedding documents, ingesting these documents into a vector DB, and applying pre-re-
trieval optimizations to improve performance. We will also set up the necessary infrastructure 
programmatically using Pulumi and conclude by deploying the RAG ingestion pipeline to AWS.
