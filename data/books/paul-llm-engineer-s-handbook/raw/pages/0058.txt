#   3.11.8
To make Python 3.11.8 the default version across your entire system (whenever you open a new 
terminal), use the following command:
pyenv global 3.11.8
However, we aim to use Python 3.11.8 locally only in our repository. To achieve that, first, we have 
to clone the repository and navigate to it:
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook.git 
cd LLM-Engineers-Handbook
Because we defined a .python-version file within the repository, pyenv will know to pick up 
the version from that file and use it locally whenever you are working within that folder. To 
double-check that, run the following command while you are in the repository:
python --version
It should output:
# Python 3.11.8
To create the .python-version file, you must run pyenv local 3.11.8 once. Then, pyenv will 
always know to use that Python version while working within a specific directory.
Now that we have installed the correct Python version using pyenv, let’s move on to Poetry, which 
we will use as our dependency and virtual environment manager.
Poetry: dependency and virtual environment management
Poetry is one of the most popular dependency and virtual environment managers within the 
Python ecosystem. But let’s start by clarifying what a dependency manager is. In Python, a depen-
dency manager allows you to specify, install, update, and manage external libraries or packages 
(dependencies) that a project relies on. For example, this is a simple Poetry requirements file that 
uses Python 3.11 and the requests and numpy Python packages.
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
requests = "^2.25.1"
numpy = "^1.19.5"
