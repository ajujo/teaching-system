The dispatcher: How do you instantiate the right crawler?
The entry point to our crawling logic is the CrawlerDispatcher class. As illustrated in Figure 
3.4, the dispatcher acts as the intermediate layer between the provided links and the crawlers. It 
knows what crawler to associate with each URL.
The CrawlerDispatcher class knows how to extract the domain of each link and initialize the 
proper crawler that collects the data from that site. For example, if it detects the https://medium.
com domain when providing a link to an article, it will build an instance of the MediumCrawler 
used to crawl that particular platform. With that in mind, let’s explore the implementation of 
the CrawlerDispatcher class.

crawlers
