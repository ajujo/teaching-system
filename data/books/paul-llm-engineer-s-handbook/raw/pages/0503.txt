MLOps Principles

The second aspect is based on the non-deterministic nature of ML processes. For example, when 
training a model from scratch, all the weights are initially randomly initialized. Thus, even if 
you use the same dataset and hyperparameters, you might end up with a model with a differ-
ent performance. This aspect can be solved by always using a seed before generating random 
numbers, as in reality, we cannot digitally create randomness, only pseudo-random numbers. 
Thus, by providing a seed, we ensure that we always produce the same trace of pseudo-random 
numbers. This can also happen at the feature engineering step, in case we impute values with 
random values or randomly remove data or labels. But as a general rule of thumb, always try to 
make your processes as deterministic as possible, and in case you have to introduce randomness, 
always provide a seed that you have control over.
