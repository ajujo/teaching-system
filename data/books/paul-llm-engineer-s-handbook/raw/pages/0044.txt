But here is where the FTI pipeline architectures kick in. The following section will show you how 
to solve these fundamental issues using an intuitive ML design.
The solution – ML pipelines for ML systems
The solution is based on creating a clear and straightforward mind map that any team or person 
can follow to compute the features, train the model, and make predictions. Based on these three 
critical steps that any ML system requires, the pattern is known as the FTI pipeline. So, how does 
this differ from what we presented before?
The pattern suggests that any ML system can be boiled down to these three pipelines: feature, 
training, and inference (similar to the DB, business logic, and UI layers from classic software). 
This is powerful, as we can clearly define the scope and interface of each pipeline. Also, it’s easier 
to understand how the three components interact. Ultimately, we have just three instead of 20 
moving pieces, as suggested in Figure 1.4, which is much easier to work with and define.
As shown in Figure 1.5, we have the feature, training, and inference pipelines. We will zoom in on 
each of them and understand their scope and interface.
