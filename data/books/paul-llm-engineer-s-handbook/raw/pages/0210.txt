System
You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a 
five year old.
Instruction
Concepts: building, shop, town
Write a sentence that includes all these words.
Output
In our little town, there is a shop inside a big building where people go to buy their favorite toys 
and candies.
Table 5.1 – Example of sample from the Open-Orca/SlimOrca dataset
This example illustrates how the “system” field is used to define specific behaviors for the model, 
such as being helpful, always providing explanations, and tailoring responses as if speaking to 
a five-year-old. The “instruction” field provides the necessary data (the concepts) and the task 
(constructing a sentence). The output field shows the expected answer, which, while not the only 
possible answer, represents a high-quality response.
To build an instruction dataset, we want to curate data that is representative of how the model will 
be used. Once we have gathered enough samples, our goal is to filter them to only keep high-quality 
data. In this context, high-quality data can be described through three main dimensions:
•	
Accuracy: It refers to the factual correctness and relevance of the samples. In the context 
of instruction datasets, this means ensuring that responses are not only factually accu-
rate but also relevant to their corresponding instructions. High accuracy is essential for 
training models that can provide reliable and trustworthy information.
•	
Diversity: A high-quality dataset should encompass a wide range of use cases, covering 
the potential queries and tasks the deployed LLM might encounter. This diversity should 
span topics, contexts, text lengths, and writing styles. By sampling data in a representative 
manner, we allow models to develop robust instruction-following capabilities.
•	
Complexity: Trivial or overly simplistic samples do little to improve an LLM’s capabilities. 
Instead, datasets should include complex, multi-step reasoning problems and challenging 
tasks that push the boundaries of what the model is expected to handle. This complexity 
helps in developing models capable of tackling complex real-world problems.
In the following sections, we will see techniques to filter and evaluate instruction samples ac-
cording to these dimensions.
