By using Poetry to pin your dependencies, you always ensure that you install the correct version 
of the dependencies that your projects work with. Poetry, by default, saves all its requirements in 
pyproject.toml files, which are stored at the root of your repository, as you can see in the cloned 
LLM-Engineers-Handbook repository.
Another massive advantage of using Poetry is that it creates a new Python virtual environment in 
which it installs the specified Python version and requirements. A virtual environment allows you 
to isolate your project’s dependencies from your global Python dependencies and other projects. 
By doing so, you ensure there are no version clashes between projects. For example, let’s assume 
that Project A needs numpy == 1.19.5, and Project B needs numpy == 1.26.0. If you keep both 
projects in the global Python environment, that will not work, as Project B will override Project A’s 
numpy installation, which will corrupt Project A and stop it from working. Using Poetry, you can 
isolate each project in its own Python environment with its own Python dependencies, avoiding 
any dependency clashes.
