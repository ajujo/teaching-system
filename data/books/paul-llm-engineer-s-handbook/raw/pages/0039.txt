Understanding the LLM Twin Concept and Architecture
8
Until now, we have examined the LLM Twin from the users’ and businesses’ perspectives. The last 
step is to examine it from an engineering perspective and define a development plan to under-
stand how to solve it technically. From now on, the book’s focus will be on the implementation 
of the LLM Twin.
Building ML systems with feature/training/inference 
pipelines
Before diving into the specifics of the LLM Twin architecture, we must understand an ML system 
pattern at the core of the architecture, known as the feature/training/inference (FTI) architecture. 
This section will present a general overview of the FTI pipeline design and how it can structure 
an ML application.
Let’s see how we can apply the FTI pipelines to the LLM Twin architecture.
The problem with building ML systems
Building production-ready ML systems is much more than just training a model. From an en-
gineering point of view, training the model is the most straightforward step in most use cases. 
However, training a model becomes complex when deciding on the correct architecture and 
hyperparameters. That’s not an engineering problem but a research problem.
At this point, we want to focus on how to design a production-ready architecture. Training a 
model with high accuracy is extremely valuable, but just by training it on a static dataset, you 
are far from deploying it robustly. We have to consider how to do the following:
•	
Ingest, clean, and validate fresh data
•	
Training versus inference setups
•	
Compute and serve features in the right environment
•	
Serve the model in a cost-effective way
•	
Version, track, and share the datasets and models
•	
Monitor your infrastructure and models
•	
Deploy the model on a scalable infrastructure
•	
Automate the deployments and training
These are the types of problems an ML or MLOps engineer must consider, while the research or 
data science team is often responsible for training the model.
