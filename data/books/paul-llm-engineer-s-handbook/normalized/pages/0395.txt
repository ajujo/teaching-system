Thus, by decoupling the components, you can scale horizontally as required, with minimal costs,
providing a cost-effective solution to your system's needs.

Additionally, each microservice can adopt the most suitable technology stack, allowing teams to
innovate and optimize independently.
However, microservices introduce complexity in deployment and maintenance. Each service
must be deployed, monitored, and maintained separately, which can be more challenging than
managing a monolithic system.
