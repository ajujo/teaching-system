Supervised Fine-Tuning

Data quantity
The Hugging Face Hub contains numerous instruction datasets, which can be general-purpose or
designed for particular tasks or domains. When working on a new use case, it can be beneficial to
look for related open-source datasets to leverage for fine-tuning. This is particularly important
if your number of samples is too low (for example, fewer than 1,000), requiring you to augment
it with high-quality data.
