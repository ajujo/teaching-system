Understanding the LLM Twin Concept and Architecture
12
In conclusion, our problem is accessing the features to make predictions without passing them at
the client's request. For example, based on our first user movie recommendation example, how
can we predict the recommendations solely based on the user's ID? Remember these questions,
as we will answer them shortly.
Ultimately, on the other spectrum, Google Cloud provides a production-ready architecture, as
shown in Figure 1.4. Unfortunately, even if it's a feasible solution, it's very complex and not intuitive. You will have difficulty understanding this if you are not highly experienced in deploying
and keeping ML models in production. Also, it is not straightforward to understand how to start
small and grow the system in time.
