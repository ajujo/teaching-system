The CT pipeline
To implement the CT pipeline, we will leverage ZenML. Once ZenML (or other orchestrators
such as Metaflow, Dagster, or Airflow) orchestrates all your pipelines and your infrastructure is
deployed, you are very close to reaching CT.
Remember the core difference between the CI/CD and CT pipelines. The CI/CD pipeline takes care
of testing, building, and deploying your code-a dimension that any software program has. The
CT pipeline leverages the code managed by the CI/CD pipeline to automate your data, training,
and model-serving process, where the data and model dimensions are present only in the AI world.
Before diving into the implementation, we want to highlight two design choices that made reaching CT simple:
