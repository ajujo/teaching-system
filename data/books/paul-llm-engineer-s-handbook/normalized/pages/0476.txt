The FTI architecture: A modular system with clear interfaces and components made it
easy to capture the relationship between the pipelines and automate them.

Starting with an orchestrator since day 0: We started with ZenML at the beginning of
the project's development. Early on, we only used it locally. But it acted as an entry point
for our pipelines and a way to monitor their execution. Doing so forced us to decouple
each pipeline and transfer the communication between them solely through various types
of data storage, such as the data warehouse, feature store, or artifact store. As we have
leveraged ZenML since day 0, we got rid of implementing a tedious CLI to configure our
application. Instead, we did it directly through YAML configuration files out of the box.
In Figure 11.19, we can see all the pipelines that we have to chain together to fully automate our
training and deployment. The pipelines aren't new; they aggregate everything we've covered
throughout this book. Thus, at this point, we will treat them as black boxes that interact with
each other.
