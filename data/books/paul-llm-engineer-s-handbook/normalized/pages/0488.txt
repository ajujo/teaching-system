Chapter 11
457
Finally, we saw how to implement a monitoring pipeline using Opik from Comet ML and an
alerting system using ZenML. These are the fundamental pillars in adding MLOps and LLMOps
to any LLM-based application.
The framework we learned about throughout the book can quickly be extrapolated to other LLM
applications. Even if we used the LLM Twin use case as an example, most of the strategies applied
can be adapted to other projects. Thus, we can get an entirely new application by changing the
data and making minor tweaks to the code. Data is the new oil, remember?
By finalizing this chapter, we've learned to build an end-to-end LLM application, starting with
data collection and fine-tuning until deploying the LLM microservice and RAG service. Throughout this book, we aimed to provide a thought framework to help you build and solve real-world
problems in the GenAI landscape. Now that you have it, we wish you good luck in your journey
and happy building!
