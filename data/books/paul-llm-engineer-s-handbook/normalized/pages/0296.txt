Even if you don't want to fine-tune a model, benchmarks like Chatbot Arena or IFEval are a good
way to compare different instruct models. For instance, you want great conversational abilities
if you're building a chatbot. However, this is not necessary if your end goal is something like
information extraction from unstructured documents. In this case, you will benefit more from
excellent instruction-following skills to understand and execute tasks.
While these benchmarks are popular and useful, they also suffer from inherent flaws. For example, public benchmarks can be gamed by training models on test data or samples that are very
similar to benchmark datasets. Even human evaluation is not perfect and is often biased toward
long and confident answers, especially when they're nicely formatted (e.g., using Markdown).
On the other hand, private test sets have not been scrutinized as much as public ones and might
have their own issues and biases.
This means that benchmarks are not a single source of truth but should be used as signals. Once
multiple evaluations provide a similar answer, you can raise your confidence level about the real
capabilities of a model.
Domain-specific LLM evaluations
Domain-specific LLMs don't have the same scope as general-purpose models. This is helpful to
target more fine-grained capabilities with more depth than the previous benchmarks.
Within the category, the choice of benchmarks entirely depends on the domain in question. For
common applications like a language-specific model or a code model, it is recommended to
search for relevant evaluations and even benchmark suites. These suites encompass different
benchmarks and are designed to be reproducible. By targeting different aspects of a domain, they
often capture domain performance more accurately.
To illustrate this, here is a list of domain-specific evaluations with leaderboards on the Hugging
Face Hub:
•
Open Medical-LLM Leaderboard: Evaluates the performance of LLMs in medical question-answering tasks. It regroups 9 metrics, with 1,273 questions from the US medical license exams (MedQA), 500 questions from PubMed articles (PubMedQA), 4,183 questions
from Indian medical entrance exams (MedMCQA), and 1,089 questions from 6 sub-categories of MMLU (clinical knowledge, medical genetics, anatomy, professional medicine,
college biology, and college medicine).
