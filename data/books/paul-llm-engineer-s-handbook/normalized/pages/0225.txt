Supervised Fine-Tuning

In-depth evolving focuses on enhancing the complexity of existing instructions. It includes
several techniques:
•
Constraints: It involves introducing additional requirements or limitations to the original
instruction, making it more challenging to fulfill.
•
Deepening: Instead of shallow questions, it tries to find more deep questions, requiring
more comprehensive responses.
•
Concretizing: It replaces general concepts with more specific ones, adding detail and
precision to the instruction.
•
Increasing reasoning steps: It modifies instructions to explicitly request multiple-step
reasoning, promoting more complex problem-solving.
•
Complicating input: This involves adding more complex data formats or structures to
the instruction, such as XML, JSON, or code snippets.
In-breadth evolving, on the other hand, aims to expand the diversity of the instruction dataset.
It generates entirely new instructions inspired by existing ones, focusing on creating more rare
or long-tailed examples within the same domain.
As an example of concrete implementation, in-depth evolving can be automated with the following prompt, from the AutoEvol paper. You simply need to provide the instruction you want
to evolve as input, and a powerful model like GPT-4o will return a more complex version of the
original instruction.
