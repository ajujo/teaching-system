CI/CD: In the final stage, you implement your CI/CD pipelines to enable fast and reliable
deployment of your ML code into production. The key advancement at this stage is the
automatic building, testing, and deployment of data, ML models, and training pipeline
components. CI/CD is used to quickly push new code into various environments, such as
staging or production, ensuring efficient and reliable deployment.
As we build our LLM system using the FTI (feature, training, inference) architecture, we can
quickly move from a manual process to CI/CD/CT. In Figure A.1, we can observe that the CT process
can be triggered by various events, such as a drop in performance detected by the monitoring
pipeline or a batch of fresh data arriving. Also, Figure A.1 is split into two main sections; the first
one highlights the automated processes, while at the bottom, we can observe the manual processes performed by the data science team while experimenting with various data processing
methods and models. Once they improve the model by tinkering with how the data is processed
or the model architecture, they push the code to the code repository, which triggers the CI/CD
pipeline to build, test, package, and deploy the new changes to the FTI pipelines.
