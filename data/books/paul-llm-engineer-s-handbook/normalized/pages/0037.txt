Note that we never said not to use OpenAI's GPT API, just that the LLM framework we will present is LLM-agnostic. Thus, if it can be manipulated programmatically and exposes a fine-tuning
interface, it can be integrated into the LLM Twin system we will learn to build. The key to most
successful ML products is to be data-centric and make your architecture model-agnostic. Thus,
you can quickly experiment with multiple models on your specific data.
Planning the MVP of the LLM Twin product
Now that we understand what an LLM Twin is and why we want to build it, we must clearly define
the product's features. In this book, we will focus on the first iteration, often labeled the minimum
viable product (MVP), to follow the natural cycle of most products. Here, the main objective is
to align our ideas with realistic and doable business objectives using the available resources to
produce the product. Even as an engineer, as you grow up in responsibilities, you must go through
these steps to bridge the gap between the business needs and what can be implemented.
What is an MVP?
An MVP is a version of a product that includes just enough features to draw in early users and test
the viability of the product concept in the initial stages of development. Usually, the purpose of
the MVP is to gather insights from the market with minimal effort.
An MVP is a powerful strategy because of the following reasons:
•
Accelerated time-to-market: Launch a product quickly to gain early traction
•
Idea validation: Test it with real users before investing in the full development of the
product
•
Market research: Gain insights into what resonates with the target audience
•
Risk minimization: Reduces the time and resources needed for a product that might not
achieve market success
Sticking to the V in MVP is essential, meaning the product must be viable. The product must
provide an end-to-end user journey without half-implemented features, even if the product is
minimal. It must be a working product with a good user experience that people will love and
want to keep using to see how it evolves to its full potential.
