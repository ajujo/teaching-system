Concept drift
In addition to changes in input and output data, their relationship can also shift. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, makes our model ineffective because the patterns it previously
learned to associate inputs with outputs become outdated. As illustrated in the following figure,
concept drifts can manifest in various ways:
•
Gradually over time
•
Suddenly, due to an external event
•
Periodically, due to recurring events
Figure A.4: Concept drift examples
For example, this happens when using the model in a different geographic area. Let's assume you
want to build a model that predicts whether a person will buy a specific car. You initially built it
for the American market. Now, you want to use it in the European market, where people tend to
buy smaller cars, creating a drift between the size feature of the car and the output probability of
purchasing the vehicle. Of course, concept drifts can be more subtle than this example.
All these types of drift can happen simultaneously, complicating pinpointing the
exact sources of drift.
