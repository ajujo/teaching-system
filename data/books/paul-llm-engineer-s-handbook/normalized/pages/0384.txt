Inference Pipeline Deployment
Deploying the inference pipeline for the large language model (LLM) Twin application is a critical
stage in the machine learning (ML) application life cycle. It's where the most value is added to
your business, making your models accessible to your end users. However, successfully deploying
AI models can be challenging, as the models require expensive computing power and access to
up-to-date features to run the inference. To overcome these constraints, it's crucial to carefully design your deployment strategy. This ensures that it meets the application's requirements,
such as latency, throughput, and costs. As we work with LLMs, we must consider the inference
optimization techniques presented in Chapter 8, such as model quantization. Also, to automate
the deployment processes, we must leverage MLOps best practices, such as model registries that
version and share our models across our infrastructure.
To understand how to design the deployment architecture of the LLM Twin, we will first look at
three deployment types we can choose from: online real-time inference, asynchronous inference,
and offline batch transform. Also, to better understand which option to choose for our LLM Twin
use case, we will quickly walk you through a set of critical criteria we must consider before making
an architectural decision, such as latency, throughput, data, and infrastructure. Also, we'll weigh
the pros and cons of monolithic and microservices architecture in model serving, a decision that
can significantly influence the scalability and maintainability of your service.Once we've grasped
the various design choices available, we'll focus on understanding the deployment strategy for
the LLM Twin's inference pipeline. Subsequently, we will walk you through an end-to-end tutorial on deploying the LLM Twin service, including deploying our custom fine-tuned LLM to
AWS SageMaker endpoints and implementing a FastAPI server as the central entry point for our
users. We will then wrap up this chapter with a short discussion on autoscaling strategies and
how to use them on SageMaker.
