One significant advantage of setting up target tracking policies using Application Auto Scaling is
that they simplify the scaling process. You no longer need to configure CloudWatch alarms and
define scaling adjustments manually.
Minimum and maximum scaling limits
When setting up autoscaling for your SageMaker Inference endpoints, it's crucial to establish
your maximum and minimum scaling limits before creating your scaling policy. The minimum
value represents the least resources your model can operate with. This value must be at least 1,
ensuring that your model always has some capacity.
Next, configure the maximum value, which defines the upper limit of resources your model can
scale up to. While the maximum must be equal to or greater than the minimum value, it doesn't
impose any upper limit. Thus, you can scale up as much as your application needs within the
boundaries of what AWS can provide.
Cooldown period
Another important aspect of a scaling policy is the cooldown period, during which it's crucial to
maintain a balance between responsiveness and stability. This cooldown period acts as a safeguard, ensuring that your system doesn't overreact during scaling events-whether it's reducing
capacity (scaling in) or increasing it (scaling out). By introducing a calculated pause, the cooldown
period prevents rapid fluctuations in the number of instances. Specifically, it delays the removal
of instances during scale-in requests and restricts the creation of new replicas during scale-out
requests. This strategy helps maintain a stable and efficient environment for LLM service.
These practical basics are used in autoscaling most web servers, including online real-time ML
servers. Once you understand how to configure scaling policies for SageMaker, you can immediately apply the strategies you've learned to other popular deployment tools like Kubernetes
or AWS ECS.
