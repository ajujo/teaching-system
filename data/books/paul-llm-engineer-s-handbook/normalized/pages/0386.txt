Low-latency systems require optimized and often more costly infrastructure, such as faster processors, lower network latency, and possibly edge computing to reduce the distance data needs
to travel.
A lower latency translates to higher throughput when the service processes multiple queries in
parallel successfully. For example, if the service takes 100 ms to process requests, this translates to
a throughput of 10 requests per second. If the latency reaches 10 ms per request, the throughput
rises to 100 requests per second.
However, to complicate things, most ML applications adopt a batching strategy to simultaneously
pass multiple data samples to the model. In this case, a lower latency can translate into lower
throughput; in other words, a higher latency maps to a higher throughput. For example, if you
process 20 batched requests in 100 ms, the latency is 100 ms, while the throughput is 200 requests
per second. If you process 60 requests in 200 ms, the latency is 200 ms, while the throughput
rises to 300 requests per second. Thus, even when batching requests at serving time, it's essential
to consider the minimum latency accepted for a good user experience.
Data
As we know, data is everywhere in an ML system. But when talking about model serving, we
mostly care about the model's input and output. This includes the format, volume, and complexity
of the processed data. Data is the foundation of the inference process. The characteristics of the
data, such as its size and type, determine how the system needs to be configured and optimized
for efficient processing.
The type and size of the data directly impact latency and throughput, as more complex or extensive data can take longer to process. For example, designing a model that takes input structured
data and outputs a probability differs entirely from an LLM that takes input text (or even images)
and outputs an array of characters.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure refers to the underlying hardware, software, networking, and system architecture
that supports the deployment and operation of the ML models. The infrastructure provides the
necessary resources for deploying, scaling, and maintaining ML models. It includes computing
resources, memory, storage, networking components, and the software stack:
•
For high throughput, the systems require scalable infrastructure to manage large data
volumes and high request rates, possibly through parallel processing, distributed systems,
and high-end GPUs.
