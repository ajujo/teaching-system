Why not use ChatGPT (or another similar chatbot)?
We have already provided the answer. ChatGPT is not personalized to your writing style and voice.
Instead, it is very generic, unarticulated, and wordy. Maintaining an original voice is critical for
long-term success when building your brand. Thus, directly using ChatGPT or Gemini will not
yield the most optimal results. Even if you are OK with sharing impersonalized content, mindlessly
using ChatGPT can result in the following:
•
Misinformation due to hallucination: Manually checking the results for hallucinations or
using third-party tools to evaluate your results is a tedious and unproductive experience.
•
Tedious manual prompting: You must manually craft your prompts and inject external
information, which is a tiresome experience. Also, the generated answers will be hard to
replicate between multiple sessions as you don't have complete control over your prompts
and injected data. You can solve part of this problem using an API and a tool such as
LangChain, but you need programming experience to do so.
From our experience, if you want high-quality content that provides real value, you will spend
more time debugging the generated text than writing it yourself.
The key of the LLM Twin stands in the following:
•
What data we collect
•
How we preprocess the data
•
How we feed the data into the LLM
•
How we chain multiple prompts for the desired results
•
How we evaluate the generated content
The LLM itself is important, but we want to highlight that using ChatGPT's web interface is
exceptionally tedious in managing and injecting various data sources or evaluating the outputs.
The solution is to build an LLM system that encapsulates and automates all the following steps
(manually replicating them each time is not a long-term and feasible solution):
•
Data collection
•
Data preprocessing
This subsection will refer to using ChatGPT (or another similar chatbot) just in the
context of generating personalized content.
