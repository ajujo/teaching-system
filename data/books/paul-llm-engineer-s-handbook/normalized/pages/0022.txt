Preface
The field of LLM engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical area in artificial intelligence and
machine learning. As LLMs continue to revolutionize natural language processing and generation, the demand for professionals who can effectively implement, optimize, and deploy these
models in real-world scenarios has grown exponentially. LLM engineering encompasses a wide
range of disciplines, from data preparation and model fine-tuning to inference optimization and
production deployment, requiring a unique blend of software engineering, machine learning
expertise, and domain knowledge.
Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) plays a crucial role in the successful implementation of
LLMs in production environments. MLOps extends the principles of DevOps to machine learning
projects, focusing on automating and streamlining the entire ML lifecycle. For LLMs, MLOps is
particularly important due to the complexity and scale of these models. It addresses challenges such as managing large datasets, handling model versioning, ensuring reproducibility, and
maintaining model performance over time. By incorporating MLOps practices, LLM projects can
achieve greater efficiency, reliability, and scalability, ultimately leading to more successful and
impactful deployments.
The LLM Engineer's Handbook is a comprehensive guide to applying best practices to the new
field of LLM engineering. Throughout the chapters, readers will find simplified key concepts,
practical techniques, and experts tips for every stage of the LLM lifecycle. The book covers topics
such as data engineering, supervised fine-tuning, model evaluation, inference optimization, and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline development.
To illustrate these concepts in action, an end-to-end project called the LLM Twin will be developed
throughout the book., with the goal of imitating someone's writing style and personality. This
use case will demonstrate how to build a minimum viable product to solve a specific problem,
using various aspects of LLM engineering and MLOps.
