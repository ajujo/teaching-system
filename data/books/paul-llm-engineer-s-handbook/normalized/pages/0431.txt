MLOps and LLMOps
400
On the implementation side of things, to add LLMOps to our LLM Twin use case, we will deploy
all our ZenML pipelines to AWS. We will implement a continuous integration and continuous
deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to test the integrity of our code and automate the deployment
process, a continuous training (CT) pipeline to automate our training, and a monitoring pipeline
to track all our prompts and generated answers. This is a natural progression in any ML project,
regardless of whether you use LLMs.
In previous chapters, you learned how to build an LLM application. Now, it's time to explore three
main goals related to LLMOps. The first one is to gain a theoretical understanding of LLMOps,
starting with DevOps, then moving to the fundamental principles of MLOps, and finally, digging
into LLMOps. We don't aim to provide the whole theory on DevOps, MLOps, and LLMOps, as
you could easily write an entire book on these topics. However, we want to build a strong understanding of why we make certain decisions when implementing the LLM Twin use case.
Our second goal is to deploy the ZenML pipelines to AWS (currently, we've deployed only our
inference pipeline to AWS in Chapter 10). This section will be hands-on, showing you how to
leverage ZenML to deploy everything to AWS. We need this to implement our third and last goal,
which is to apply what we've learned in the theory section to our LLM Twin use case. We will
implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, a CT and alerting pipeline using ZenML, and
a monitoring pipeline using Opik from Comet ML.
Thus, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
•
The path to LLMOps: Understanding its roots in DevOps and MLOps
•
Deploying the LLM Twin's pipelines to the cloud
•
Adding LLMOps to the LLM Twin
The path to LLMOps: Understanding its roots in
DevOps and MLOps
To understand LLMOps, we have to start with the field's beginning, which is DevOps, as it inherits
most of its fundamental principles from there. Then, we will move to MLOps to understand how
the DevOps domain was adapted to support ML systems. Finally, we will explain what LLMOps
is and how it emerged from MLOps after the widespread adoption of LLMs.
