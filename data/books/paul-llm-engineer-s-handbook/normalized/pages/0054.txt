Also, each pipeline will be scaled differently. The data and feature pipelines will be scaled horizontally based on the CPU and RAM load. The training pipeline will be scaled vertically by adding more
GPUs. The inference pipeline will be scaled horizontally based on the number of client requests.
To conclude, the presented LLM architecture checks all the technical requirements listed at the
beginning of the section. It processes the data as requested, and the training is modular and can
be quickly adapted to different LLMs, datasets, or fine-tuning techniques. The inference pipeline
supports RAG and is exposed as a REST API. On the LLMOps side, the system supports dataset and
model versioning, lineage, and reusability. The system has a monitoring service, and the whole
ML architecture is designed with CT/CI/CD in mind.
This concludes the high-level overview of the LLM Twin architecture.
Summary
This first chapter was critical to understanding the book's goal. As a product-oriented book that
will walk you through building an end-to-end ML system, it was essential to understand the
concept of an LLM Twin initially. Afterward, we walked you through what an MVP is and how
to plan our LLM Twin MVP based on our available resources. Following this, we translated our
concept into a practical technical solution with specific requirements. In this context, we introduced the FTI design pattern and showcased its real-world application in designing systems that
are both modular and scalable. Ultimately, we successfully applied the FTI pattern to design the
architecture of the LLM Twin to fit all our technical requirements.
Having a clear vision of the big picture is essential when building systems. Understanding how
a single component will be integrated into the rest of the application can be very valuable when
working on it. We started with a more abstract presentation of the LLM Twin architecture, focusing on each component's scope, interface, and interconnectivity.
The following chapters will explore how to implement and deploy each component. On the
MLOps side, we will walk you through using a computing platform, orchestrator, model registry,
artifacts, and other tools and concepts to support all MLOps best practices.
