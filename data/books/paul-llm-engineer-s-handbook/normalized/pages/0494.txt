Stress tests: These tests evaluate the system's performance and stability under extreme
conditions, such as high load or limited resources. They aim to identify breaking points
and ensure the system can handle unexpected spikes in demand or adverse situations
without failing.
Figure A.2: Test types
We've intentionally left regression tests out of the preceding figure because they aren't a distinct
testing phase. Instead, regression testing is applied across all levels-unit, integration, system,
acceptance, and stress tests-to ensure that changes don't reintroduce previous errors. It's an
ongoing process within these phases, not a separate type of test, which is why it's not shown as
a separate category.
What do we test?
When writing most tests, you take a component and treat it as a black box. Thus, what you have
control over is the input and output. You want to test that you get an expected output for a given
input. With that in mind, here are a few things you should usually test:
•
Inputs: Data types, format, length, and edge cases (min/max, small/large, etc.)
•
Outputs: Data types, formats, exceptions, and intermediary and final outputs
Test examples
When testing your code, you can leverage the standards from classic software engineering. Here
are a few examples of code tests you can include when writing unit tests to get a better idea of
what we want to test at this point-for instance, you want to check that a sentence is cleaned
as expected.
