•
Version control: Used to track, manage, and version every change made to the source code.
This allows you to have complete control over the evolution of the code and deployment
processes. For example, without versioning, tracking changes between the dev, staging,
and production environments would be impossible. By versioning your software, you
always know what version is stable and ready to be shipped.
•
Continuous integration (CI): Before pushing the code into the dev, staging, and production main branches, you automatically build your application and run automated tests
on each change. After all the automated tests pass, the feature branch can be merged into
the main one.
•
Continuous delivery (CD): Continuous delivery works in conjunction with CI and automates the infrastructure provisioning and application deployment steps. For example,
after the code is merged into the staging environment, the application with the latest
changes will be automatically deployed on top of your staging infrastructure. After, the
QA team (or stakeholders) starts manually testing the latest features to verify that they
work as expected. These two steps are commonly referred to together as CI/CD.
Note that DevOps suggests a set of core principles that are platform/tool agnostic. However,
within our LLM Twin use case, we will add a version control layer using GitHub, which aims to
track the evolution of the code. Another popular tool for version control is GitLab. To implement
the CI/CD pipeline, we will leverage the GitHub ecosystem and GitHub Actions, which are free
for open-source projects. Other tool choices are GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and Jenkins. Usually,
you pick the DevOps tool based on your development environment, customization, and privacy
needs. For example, Jenkins is an open-source DevOps tool you can host yourself and control
fully. The downside is that you must host and maintain it yourself, adding a complexity layer.
Thus, many companies choose what works best with their version control ecosystem, such as
GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
Now that we've established a solid understanding of DevOps, let's explore how the MLOps field
has emerged to keep these same core principles in the AI/ML world.
MLOps
As you might have worked out by now, MLOps tries to apply the DevOps principles to ML. The core
issue is that an ML application has many other moving parts compared to a standard software
application, such as the data, model, and, finally, the code. MLOps aims to track, operationalize,
and monitor all these concepts for better reproducibility, robustness, and control.
