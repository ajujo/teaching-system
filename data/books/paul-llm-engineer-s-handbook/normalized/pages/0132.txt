Hallucinations
If a chatbot without RAG is asked a question about something it wasn't trained on, there is a high
chance that it will give you a confident answer about something that isn't true. Let's take the 2024
European Football Championship as an example. If the model is trained up to October 2023 and
we ask it something about the tournament, it will most likely come up with a random answer
that is hard to differentiate between reality and truth. Even if the LLM doesn't hallucinate all the
time, it raises concerns about the trustworthiness of its answers. Thus, we must ask ourselves:
"When can we trust the LLM's answers?" and "How can we evaluate if the answers are correct?".
By introducing RAG, we enforce the LLM to always answer solely based on the introduced context. The LLM will act as the reasoning engine, while the additional information added through
RAG will act as the single source of truth for the generated answer. By doing so, we can quickly
evaluate if the LLM's answer is based on the external data or not.
Old information
Any LLM is trained or fine-tuned on a subset of the total world knowledge dataset. This is due
to three main issues:
•
Private data: You cannot train your model on data you don't own or have the right to use.
•
New data: New data is generated every second. Thus, you would have to constantly train
your LLM to keep up.
•
Costs: Training or fine-tuning an LLM is an extremely costly operation. Hence, it is not
feasible to do it on an hourly or daily basis.
RAG solves these issues, as you no longer have to constantly fine-tune your LLM on new data (or
even private data). Directly injecting the necessary data to respond to user questions into the
prompts that are fed to the LLM is enough to generate correct and valuable answers.
To conclude, RAG is key for a robust and flexible generative AI system. But how do we inject the
right data into the prompt based on the user's questions? We will dig into the technical aspects
of RAG in the next sections.
The vanilla RAG framework
Every RAG system is similar at its roots. We will first focus on understanding RAG in its simplest
form. Later, we will gradually introduce more advanced RAG techniques to improve the system's
accuracy. Note that we will use vanilla and naive RAG interchangeably to avoid repetition.
