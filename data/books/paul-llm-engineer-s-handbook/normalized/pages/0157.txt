RAG Feature Pipeline

For example, if you work with multi-modal data such as text and images, most of the techniques
from earlier won't work as they are designed for text only.

To summarize, the primary goal of these optimizations is to enhance the RAG algorithm at three key
stages: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval. This involves preprocessing data for improved
vector indexing, adjusting user queries for more accurate searches, enhancing the embedding
model, utilizing classic filtering DB operations, and removing noisy data. By keeping these goals
in mind, you can effectively optimize your RAG workflow for data processing and retrieval
