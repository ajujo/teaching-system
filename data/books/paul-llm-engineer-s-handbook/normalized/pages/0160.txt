Designing the architecture of the RAG feature pipeline
The last step is to architect and go through the design of the RAG feature pipeline of the LLM
Twin application. We will use a batch design scheduled to poll data from the MongoDB data
warehouse, process it, and load it to a Qdrant vector DB. The first question to ask ourselves is,
"Why a batch pipeline?"
But before answering that, let's quickly understand how a batch architecture works and behaves
relative to a streaming design.
