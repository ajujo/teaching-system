As my co-founder at Hugging Face, Clement Delangue, and I often say, AI is becoming the default
way of building technology.
Over the past 3 years, LLMs have already had a profound impact on technology, and they are
bound to have an even greater impact in the coming 5 years. They will be embedded in more and
more products and, I believe, at the center of any human activity based on knowledge or creativity.
For instance, coders are already leveraging LLMs and changing the way they work, focusing on
higher-order thinking and tasks while collaborating with machines. Studio musicians rely on
AI-powered tools to explore the musical creativity space faster. Lawyers are increasing their impact
through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large databases of case law.
At Hugging Face, we've always advocated for a future where not just one company or a small
number of scientists control the AI models used by the rest of the population, but instead for a
future where as many people as possible-from as many different backgrounds as possible-are
capable of diving into how cutting-edge machine learning models actually work.
Maxime Labonne and Paul Iusztin have been instrumental in this movement to democratize
LLMs by writing this book and making sure that as many people as possible can not only use
them but also adapt them, fine-tune them, quantize them, and make them efficient enough to
actually deploy in the real world.
Their work is essential, and I'm glad they are making this resource available to the community.
This expands the convex hull of human knowledge.
