To get the most out of this book
To maximize your learning experience, you are expected to have, at the very least, a foundational
understanding of software development principles and practices. Familiarity with Python programming is particularly beneficial, as the book's examples and code snippets are predominantly
in Python. While prior experience with machine learning concepts is advantageous, it is not
strictly necessary, as the book provides explanations for many fundamental AI and ML concepts.
However, you should be comfortable with basic data structures, algorithms, and have some experience working with APIs and cloud services.
Familiarity with version control systems like Git is assumed, as this book has a GitHub repository for code examples. While this book is designed to be accessible to those who are new to AI
and LLMs, if you have some background in these areas, you will find it easier to grasp the more
advanced concepts and techniques we present.

Conventions used
There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.
CodeInText: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file
extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. For example: "In the
format_samples function, we apply the Alpaca chat template to each individual message."
A block of code is set as follows:
def format_samples(example):
    example["prompt"] = alpaca_template.format(example["prompt"])
    example["chosen"] = example['chosen'] + EOS_TOKEN
    example["rejected"] = example['rejected'] + EOS_TOKEN
    return {"prompt": example["prompt"], "chosen": example["chosen"],
"rejected": example["rejected"]}
