Figure 11.5: Infrastructure flow
Now that we understand what the essential resources of our infrastructure are, let's look over the

1.
Build a Docker image that contains all the system dependencies, the project dependencies,
and the LLM Twin application.
2.
Push the Docker image to ECR, where SageMaker can access it.
