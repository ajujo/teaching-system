Other popular orchestrators similar to ZenML that we've personally tested and consider powerful
are Airflow, Prefect, Metaflow, and Dagster. Also, if you are a heavy user of Kubernetes, you can
opt for Agro Workflows or Kubeflow, the latter of which works only on top of Kubernetes. We still
consider ZenML the best trade-off between ease of use, features, and costs. Also, none of these
tools offer the stack feature that is offered by ZenML, which allows it to avoid vendor-locking
you in to any cloud ecosystem.
In Chapter 11, we will explore in more depth how to leverage an orchestrator to implement MLOps
best practices. But now that we understand ZenML, what it is helpful for, and how to use it, let's
move on to the experiment tracker.
Comet ML: experiment tracker
Training ML models is an entirely iterative and experimental process. Unlike traditional software
development, it involves running multiple parallel experiments, comparing them based on predefined metrics, and deciding which one should advance to production. An experiment tracking
tool allows you to log all the necessary information, such as metrics and visual representations
of your model predictions, to compare all your experiments and quickly select the best model.
Our LLM project is no exception.
As illustrated in Figure 2.11, we used Comet to track metrics such as training and evaluation loss
or the value of the gradient norm across all our experiments.
