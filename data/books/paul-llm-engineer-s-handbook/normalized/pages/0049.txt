Understanding the LLM Twin Concept and Architecture
18
Given our goal of building an MVP with a small team, we must implement the entire application.
This includes defining the data collection and FTI pipelines. Tackling a problem end to end is
often encountered in start-ups that can't afford dedicated teams. Thus, engineers have to wear
many hats, depending on the state of the product. Nevertheless, in any scenario, knowing how
an end-to-end ML system works is valuable for better understanding other people's work.
Figure 1.6 shows the LLM system architecture. The best way to understand it is to review the four
components individually and explain how they work.
