DevOps
Manually shipping software is time-consuming, error-prone, involves security risks, and doesn't
scale. Thus, DevOps was born to automate the process of shipping software at scale. More specifically, DevOps is used in software development, where you want to completely automate your
building, testing, deploying, and monitoring components. It is a methodology designed to shorten
the development lifecycle and ensure continuous delivery of high-quality software. It encourages
collaboration, automates processes, integrates workflows, and implements rapid feedback loops.
These elements contribute to a culture where building, testing, and releasing software becomes
more reliable and faster.
Embracing a DevOps culture offers significant advantages to an organization, primarily boosting
operational efficiency, speeding up feature delivery, and enhancing product quality. Some of the
main benefits include:
•
Improved collaboration: DevOps is pivotal in creating a more unified working environment. Eliminating the barriers between development and operations teams fosters
enhanced communication and teamwork, leading to a more efficient and productive
workplace.
•
Boosted efficiency: Automating the software development lifecycle reduces manual tasks,
errors, and delivery times.
•
Ongoing improvement: DevOps is not just about internal processes. It's about ensuring
that the software effectively meets user needs. Promoting a culture of continuous feedback
enables teams to quickly adapt and enhance their processes, thereby delivering software
that genuinely satisfies the end users.
•
Superior quality and security: DevOps ensures swift software development while maintaining high quality and security standards through CI/CD and proactive security measures.
The DevOps lifecycle
As illustrated in Figure 11.1, the DevOps lifecycle encompasses the entire journey from the inception
of software development to its delivery, upkeep, and security. The key stages of this lifecycle are:
1.
Plan: Organize and prioritize the tasks, ensuring each is tracked to completion.
2.
Code: Collaborate with your team to write, design, develop, and securely manage code
and project data.
