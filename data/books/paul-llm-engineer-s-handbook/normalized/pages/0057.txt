Tooling and Installation
26
If you are familiar with these tools, you can safely skip this chapter. We also explain how to install the project and set up all the necessary components in the repository's README. Thus, you
also have the option to use that as more concise documentation if you plan to run the code while
reading the book.
To sum all that up, in this chapter, we will explore the following topics:
•
Python ecosystem and project installation
•
MLOps and LLMOps tooling
•
Databases for storing unstructured and vector data
•
Preparing for AWS
By the end of this chapter, you will be aware of all the tools we will use across the book. Also, you
will have learned how to install the LLM-Engineers-Handbook repository, set up the rest of the
tools, and use them if you run the code while reading the book.
Python ecosystem and project installation
Any Python project needs three fundamental tools: the Python interpreter, dependency management, and a task execution tool. The Python interpreter executes your Python project as expected.
All the code within the book is tested with Python 3.11.8. You can download the Python interpreter
from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/. We recommend installing the exact Python
version (Python 3.11.8) to run the LLM Twin project using pyenv, making the installation process
straightforward.
Instead of installing multiple global Python versions, we recommend managing them using pyenv,
a Python version management tool that lets you manage multiple Python versions between
projects. You can install it using this link: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ovfile#installation.
After you have installed pyenv, you can install the latest version of Python 3.11, using pyenv, as
follows:
pyenv install 3.11.8
Now list all installed Python versions to see that it was installed correctly:
pyenv versions
You should see something like this:
