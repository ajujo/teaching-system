If any of the steps from the QA or test jobs fail, the GitHub Actions workflow will fail, resulting
in the PR not being able to be merged until the issue is fixed. By taking this approach, we ensure
that all the new features added to the main branches respect the standard of the project and that
it doesn't break existing functionality through automated tests.
Figure 11.15 shows the CI pipeline in the Actions tab of the GitHub repository. It was run after a
