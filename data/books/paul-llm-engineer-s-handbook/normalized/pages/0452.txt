8.	 Click the Deploy to AWS button. It will open a CloudFormation page on AWS. ZenML
leverages CloudFormation (an infrastructure as code, or IaC, tool) to create all the AWS
resources we enumerated in Step 6.
9.	 At the bottom, check all the boxes to acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation will create
AWS resources on your behalf. Finally, click the Create stack button. Now, we must wait
for a couple of minutes for AWS CloudFormation to spin up all the resources.
10.	 Return to the ZenML page and click the Finish button.
By leveraging ZenML, we efficiently deployed the entire AWS infrastructure for our ML
pipelines. We began with a basic example, sacrificing some control. However, if you seek
more control, ZenML offers the option to use Terraform (an IaC tool) to fully control your
AWS resources or to connect ZenML with your current infrastructure.
Before moving to the next step, let's have a quick recap of the AWS resources we just
created:
•
An IAM role is an AWS identity with permissions policies that define what actions
are allowed or denied for that role. It is used to grant access to AWS services without needing to share security credentials.
•
S3 is a scalable and secure object storage service that allows storing and retrieving
files from anywhere on the web. It is commonly used for data backup, content
storage, and data lakes. It's more scalable and flexible than Google Drive.
•
ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes storing, managing,
and deploying Docker container images easy.
•
SageMaker is a fully managed service that allows developers and data scientists
to quickly build, train, and deploy ML models.
•
SageMaker Orchestrator is a feature of SageMaker that helps automate the execution of ML workflows, manage dependencies between steps, and ensure the
reproducibility and scalability of model training and deployment pipelines. Other
similar tools are Prefect, Dagster, Metaflow, and Airflow.
•
CloudFormation is a service that allows you to model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing them and more time focusing
on your applications. It automates the process of provisioning AWS infrastructure
using templates.
Before running the ML pipelines, the last step is to containerize the code and prepare a Docker
image that packages our dependencies and code.
