Understanding the LLM Twin
Concept and Architecture
By the end of this book, we will have walked you through the journey of building an end-to-end
large language model (LLM) product. We firmly believe that the best way to learn about LLMs
and production machine learning (ML) is to get your hands dirty and build systems. This book
will show you how to build an LLM Twin, an AI character that learns to write like a particular
person by incorporating its style, voice, and personality into an LLM. Using this example, we will
walk you through the complete ML life cycle, from data gathering to deployment and monitoring.
Most of the concepts learned while implementing your LLM Twin can be applied in other LLM-
based or ML applications.
When starting to implement a new product, from an engineering point of view, there are three
planning steps we must go through before we start building. First, it is critical to understand the
problem we are trying to solve and what we want to build. In our case, what exactly is an LLM Twin,
and why build it? This step is where we must dream and focus on the "Why." Secondly, to reflect
a real-world scenario, we will design the first iteration of a product with minimum functionality.
Here, we must clearly define the core features required to create a working and valuable product.
The choices are made based on the timeline, resources, and team's knowledge. This is where we
bridge the gap between dreaming and focusing on what is realistic and eventually answer the
following question: "What are we going to build?".
Finally, we will go through a system design step, laying out the core architecture and design choices
used to build the LLM system. Note that the first two components are primarily product-related,
while the last one is technical and focuses on the "How."
