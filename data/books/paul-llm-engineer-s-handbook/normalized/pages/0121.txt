We configured a different pipeline run for each author. We provided a ZenML configuration file for
Paul Iusztin's or Maxime Labonne's data. To call the data collection pipeline to collect Maxime's
data, for example, you can run the following CLI command:
poetry poe run-digital-data-etl-maxime
That will call the pipeline with the following ZenML YAML configuration file:
parameters:
  user_full_name: Maxime Labonne # [First Name(s)] [Last Name]

In Figure 3.3 earlier, we saw the pipeline's run DAG and details in ZenML's dashboard. Meanwhile,
Figure 3.5 shows the user output artifact generated by this data collection pipeline. You can inspect the query user_full_name and the retrieved user from the MongoDB database, for which
we collected the links in this specific run.
