When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or
items are set in bold:
def format_samples(example):
    example["prompt"] = alpaca_template.format(example["prompt"])
    example["chosen"] = example['chosen'] + EOS_TOKEN
    example["rejected"] = example['rejected'] + EOS_TOKEN
    return {"prompt": example["prompt"], "chosen": example["chosen"],
"rejected": example["rejected"]}
Any command-line input or output is written as follows:
poetry install --without aws
Bold: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see on the screen. For instance,
words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. For example: "To do so, go to the Settings tab at the top of the forked repository in GitHub. In the left panel, in the Security section,
click on the Secrets and Variables toggle and, finally, click on Actions."
