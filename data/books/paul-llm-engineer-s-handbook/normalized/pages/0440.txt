Managing massive datasets and multi-GPU clusters involves substantial costs. For example, the estimated training cost for GPT-4 is around $100 million, as stated by Sam
Altman, the CEO of OpenAI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4#Training). Add to
that the costs of multiple experiments, evaluation, and inference. Even if these numbers
are not exact, as the sources are not 100% reliable, the scale of the costs of training an
LLM is trustworthy, which implies that only the large players in the industry can afford
to train LLMs from scratch.
At its core, LLMOps is MLOps at scale. It uses the same MLOps principles but is applied to big data
and huge models that require more computing power to train and run. However, due to its huge
scale, the most significant trend is the shift away from training neural networks from scratch for
specific tasks. This approach is becoming obsolete with the rise of fine-tuning, especially with
the advent of foundation models such as GPT. A few organizations with extensive computational
resources, such as OpenAI and Google, develop these foundation models. Thus, most applications now rely on the lightweight fine-tuning of parts of these models, prompt engineering, or
optionally distilling data or models into smaller, specialized inference networks.
Thus, for most LLM applications out there, your development steps will involve the selection of a
foundation model, which you further have to optimize by using prompt engineering, fine-tuning,
or RAG. Thus, the operational aspect of these three steps is the most critical to understand. Let's
dive into some popular components of LLMOps that can improve prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and RAG.
Human feedback
One valuable refinement step of your LLM is aligning it with your audience's preferences. You
must introduce a feedback loop within your application and gather a human feedback dataset
to further fine-tune the LLM with techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human
Feedback (RLHF) or more advanced ones such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). One
popular feedback loop is the thumbs-up/thumbs-down button present in most chatbot interfaces.
You can read more on preference alignment in Chapter 6.
Guardrails
Unfortunately, LLM systems are not reliable, as they often hallucinate. You can optimize your
system against hallucinations, but as hallucinations are hard to detect and can take many forms,
there are significant changes that will still happen in the future.
