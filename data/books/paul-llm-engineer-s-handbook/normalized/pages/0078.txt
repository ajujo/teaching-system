When interacting with an LLM application, you chain multiple input prompts and the generated
output into a trace, where one prompt depends on previous prompts.
Thus, instead of plain text logs, you need an intuitive way to group these traces into a specialized
dashboard that makes debugging and monitoring traces of prompts easier.
We used Opik, an open-source tool made by Comet, as our prompt monitoring tool because it follows Comet's philosophy of simplicity and ease of use, which is currently relatively rare in the LLM
landscape. Other options offering similar features are Langfuse (open source, https://langfuse.
com), Galileo (not open source, rungalileo.io), and LangSmith (not open source, https://www.
langchain.com/langsmith), but we found their solutions more cumbersome to use and implement. Opik, along with its serverless option, also provides a free open-source version that you
have complete control over. You can read more on Opik at https://github.com/comet-ml/opik.
Databases for storing unstructured and vector data
We also want to present the NoSQL and vector databases we will use within our examples. When
working locally, they are already integrated through Docker. Thus, when running poetry poe
local-infrastructure-up, as instructed a few sections above, local images of Docker for both
databases will be pulled and run on your machine. Also, when deploying the project, we will
show you how to use their serverless option and integrate it with the rest of the LLM Twin project.
MongoDB: NoSQL database
MongoDB is one of today's most popular, robust, fast, and feature-rich NoSQL databases. It
integrates well with most cloud ecosystems, such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and Databricks.
Thus, using MongoDB as our NoSQL database was a no-brainer.
When we wrote this book, MongoDB was used by big players such as Novo Nordisk, Delivery
Hero, Okta, and Volvo. This widespread adoption suggests that MongoDB will remain a leading
NoSQL database for a long time.
We use MongoDB as a NoSQL database to store the raw data we collect from the internet before
processing it and pushing it into the vector database. As we work with unstructured text data,
the flexibility of the NoSQL database fits like a charm.
Qdrant: vector database
Qdrant (https://qdrant.tech/) is one of the most popular, robust, and feature-rich vector
databases. We could have used almost any vector database for our small MVP, but we wanted to
pick something light and likely to be used in the industry for many years to come.
