Artifacts and metadata
As mentioned in the previous section, ZenML transforms any step output into an artifact. First,
let's quickly understand what an artifact is. In MLOps, an artifact is any file(s) produced during
the machine learning lifecycle, such as datasets, trained models, checkpoints, or logs. Artifacts
are crucial for reproducing experiments and deploying models. We can transform anything into
an artifact. For example, the model registry is a particular use case for an artifact. Thus, artifacts
have these unique properties: they are versioned, sharable, and have metadata attached to them
to understand what's inside quickly. For example, when wrapping your dataset with an artifact,
you can add to its metadata the size of the dataset, the train-test split ratio, the size, types of labels,
and anything else useful to understand what's inside the dataset without actually downloading it.
Let's circle back to our digital_data_etl pipeline example, where we had as a step output an artifact, the crawled links, which are an artifact, as seen in Figure 2.7
