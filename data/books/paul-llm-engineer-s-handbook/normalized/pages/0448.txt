d.	 Choose Frankfurt (eu-central-1) as your region. You can choose another region,
but be careful to choose the same region for all future AWS services.
e.
Leave the rest of the attributes with their default values.
f.
In the bottom right, click the Create Deployment green button.
4.
To test that your newly created MongoDB cluster works fine, we must connect to it from
our local machine. We used the MongoDB VS Code extension to do so, but you can use any
other tool. Thus, from their Choose a connection method setup flow, choose MongoDB
for VS Code. Then, follow the steps provided on their site.
5.
To connect, you must paste the DB connection URL in the VS Code extension (or another
tool of your liking), which contains your username, password, and cluster URL, similar
to this one: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password> @twin.vhxy1.mongodb.net. Make
sure to save this URL somewhere you can copy it from later.
6.
If you don't know or want to change your password, go to Security → Quickstart in the
left panel. There, you can edit your login credentials. Be sure to save them somewhere
safe, as you won't be able to access them later.
7.
After verifying that your connections work, go to Security → Network Access in the left
panel and click ADD IP ADDRESS. Then click ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE and
hit Confirm. Out of simplicity, we allow any machine from any IP to access our MongoDB
cluster. This ensures that our pipelines can query or write to the DB without any additional complex networking setup. It's not the safest option for production, but for our
example, it's perfectly fine.
8.	 The final step is to return to your project and open your .env file. Now, either add or replace the DATABASE_HOST variable with your MongoDB connection string. It should look
something like this: DATABASE_HOST= mongodb+srv://<username>:<password> @twin.
vhxy1.mongodb.net.
That's it! Now, instead of reading and writing from your local MongoDB, you will do it from the
cloud MongoDB cluster we just created. Let's repeat a similar process with Qdrant.
Setting up Qdrant
We have to repeat a similar process to what we did for MongoDB. Thus, to create a Qdrant cluster
and hook it to our project, follow these steps:
1.
Go to Qdrant at https://cloud.qdrant.io/ and create an account.
2.
In the left panel, go to Clusters and click Create.
