•
Invariance: Changes in your input should not affect the output-for example, below is
an example based on synonym injection:
model(text="The advancements in AI are changing the world rapidly.")
# output: ai
model(text="The progress in AI is changing the world rapidly.")
# output: ai
•
Directional: Changes in your input should affect the outputs-for example, below is an
example where we know the outputs should change based on the provided inputs:
model(text="Deep learning used for sentiment analysis.")
# output: deep-learning
model(text="Deep learning used for object detection.")
# output: deep-learning
model(text="RNNs for sentiment analysis.")
# output: rnn
•
Minimum functionality: The most simple combination of inputs and expected outputsfor example, below is a set of simple examples that we expect the model should always
get right:
model(text="NLP is the next big wave in machine learning.")
# output: nlp
model(text="MLOps is the next big wave in machine learning.")
# output: mlops
model(text="This is about graph neural networks.")
# output: gnn
