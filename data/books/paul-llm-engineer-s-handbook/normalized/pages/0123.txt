We want to highlight again the power of these artifacts, as they trace each pipeline's results and
metadata, making it extremely easy to monitor and debug each pipeline run individually.
Figure 3.6: Example of the crawled_links output artifact after running the data collection
pipeline using Maxime's configuration file
Now, we can download the crawled_links artifact anywhere in our code by running the following
code, where the ID of the artifact can be found in ZenML and is unique for every artifact version:
from zenml.client import Client
artifact = Client().get_artifact_version('8349ce09-0693-4e28-8fa2-
20f82c76ddec')
loaded_artifact = artifact.load()
