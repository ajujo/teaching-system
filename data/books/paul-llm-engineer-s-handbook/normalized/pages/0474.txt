The last step in setting up the CI/CD pipeline is to test it and see how it works.
Test out the CI/CD pipeline
To test the CI/CD pipelines yourself, you must fork the LLM-Engineering repository to have full
write access to the GitHub repository. Here is the official tutorial on how to fork a GitHub project:
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/workingwith-forks/fork-a-repo
The last step is to set up a few secrets that will allow the CD pipeline to log in to AWS and point
to the right ECR resource. To do so, go to the Settings tab at the top of the forked repository in
GitHub. In the left panel, in the Security section, click on the Secrets and Variables toggle and,
finally, on Actions. Then, on the Secrets tab, create four repository secrets, as shown in Figure
11.17. These secrets will be securely stored and accessible only by the GitHub Actions CD pipeline.
The AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are the AWS credentials you used across
the book. In Chapter 2, you see how to create them. The AWS_REGION (e.g., eu-central-1) and
AWS_ECR_NAME are the same ones used in the Deploying the LLM Twin's pipelines to the cloud
section.
To trigger the CI pipeline, create a feature branch, modify the code or documentation, and create
a PR to the main branch. To trigger the CD pipeline, merge the PR into the main branch.
For the AWS_ECR_NAME, you should configure only the name of the repository (e.g.,
zenml-vrsopg) and not the full URI (e.g., 992382797823.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.
amazonaws.com/zenml-vrsopg), as seen in the image below:
