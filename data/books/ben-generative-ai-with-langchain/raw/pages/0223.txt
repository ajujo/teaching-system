Tools that give an LLM access to databases by writing and executing SQL code: For ex­
ample, SQLDatabase includes tools to get information about the database and its objects 
and execute SQL queries. You can also access Google Drive with GoogleDriveLoader or 
perform operations with usual file system tools from a FileManagementToolkit.
•	
Other tools: These comprise tools that integrate third-party systems and allow the LLM to 
gather additional information or act. There are also tools that can integrate data retrieval 
from Google Maps, NASA, and other platforms and organizations.
•	
Tools for using other AI systems or automation:
•	
Image generation: DALL-E and Imagen
•	
Speech synthesis: Google Cloud TTS and Eleven Labs
•	
Model access: Hugging Face Hub
•	
Workflow automation: Zapier and IFTTT
Any external system with an API can be wrapped as a tool if it enhances an LLM like this: 
•	
Provides relevant domain knowledge to the user or the workflow
•	
Allows an LLM to take actions on the user’s behalf 
When integrating such tools with LangChain, consider these key aspects:
•	
Authentication: Secure access to the external system
•	
Payload schema: Define proper data structures for input/output
•	
Error handling: Plan for failures and edge cases
•	
Safety considerations: For example, when developing a SQL-to-text agent, restrict access 
to read-only operations to prevent unintended modifications
Therefore, an important toolkit is the RequestsToolkit, which allows one to easily wrap any 
HTTP API:
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.openapi.toolkit import 
RequestsToolkit
from langchain_community.utilities.requests import TextRequestsWrapper
toolkit = RequestsToolkit(
   requests_wrapper=TextRequestsWrapper(headers={}),
   allow_dangerous_requests=True,
)
