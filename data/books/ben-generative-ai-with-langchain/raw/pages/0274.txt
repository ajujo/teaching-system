If we run it, we will see that at every stage, the graph operates on the same (and growing) list of

LangGraph platform
LangGraph and LangChain, as you know, are open-source frameworks, but LangChain as a com­
pany offers the LangGraph platform – a commercial solution that helps you develop, manage, and 
deploy agentic applications. One component of the LangGraph platform is LangGraph Studio – an 
IDE that helps you visualize and debug your agents – and another is LangGraph Server.
You can read more about the LangGraph platform at the official website (https://langchain-ai.
github.io/langgraph/concepts/#langgraph-platform), but let’s discuss a few key concepts 
for a better understanding of what it means to develop an agent.
After you’ve developed an agent, you can wrap it as an HTTP API (using Flask, FastAPI, or any 
other web framework). The LangGraph platform offers you a native way to deploy agents, and it 
wraps them with a unified API (which makes it easier for your applications to use these agents). 
When you’ve built your agent as a LangGraph graph object, you deploy an assistant – a specific 
deployment that includes an instance of your graph coupled together with a configuration. You 
can easily version and configure assistants in the UI, but it’s important to keep parameters con­
figurable (and pass them as RunnableConfig to your nodes and tools).
Another important concept is a thread. Don’t be confused, a LangGraph thread is a different 
concept from a Python thread (and when you pass a thread_id in your RunnableConfig, you’re 
passing a LangGraph thread ID). When you think about LangGraph threads, think about con­
versation or Reddit threads. A thread represents a session between your assistant (a graph with 
a specific configuration) and a user. You can add per-thread persistence using the checkpointing 
mechanism we discussed in Chapter 3.
A run is an invocation of an assistant. In most cases, runs are executed on a thread (for persistence). 
LangGraph Server also allows you to schedule stateless runs – they are not assigned to any thread, 
and because of that, the history of interactions is not persisted. LangGraph Server allows you to 
schedule long-running runs, scheduled runs (a.k.a. crons), etc., and it also offers a rich mechanism 
for webhooks attached to runs and polling results back to the user.
