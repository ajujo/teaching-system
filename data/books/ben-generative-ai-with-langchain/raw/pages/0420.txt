Here’s a tracing example in LangSmith for a benchmark dataset run:
Figure 9.5: Tracing in LangSmith
The platform itself is not open source; however, LangChain AI, the company behind LangSmith and 
LangChain, provides some support for self-hosting for organizations with privacy concerns. There 
are a few alternatives to LangSmith, such as Langfuse, Weights & Biases, Datadog APM, Portkey, 
and PromptWatch, with some overlap in features. We’ll focus on LangSmith here because it has 
a large set of features for evaluation and monitoring, and because it integrates with LangChain.
Observability strategy
While it’s tempting to monitor everything, it’s more effective to focus on the metrics that matter 
most for your specific application. Core performance metrics—such as latency, success rates, 
and token usage—should always be tracked. Beyond that, tailor your monitoring to the use case: 
for a customer service bot, prioritize metrics like user satisfaction and task completion, while a 
content generator may require tracking originality and adherence to style or tone guidelines. It’s 
also important to align technical monitoring with business impact metrics, such as conversion 
rates or customer retention, to ensure that engineering efforts support broader goals.
