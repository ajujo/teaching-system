techniques 
- context 
processing
Optimizes 
retrieved 
documents 
before 
sending 
to the 
generator 
(compres­
sion, MMR)
•	 Maximizes con­
text window 
utilization
•	 Reduces 
redundancy 
Focuses on 
most relevant 
information
•	 Risk of remov­
ing important 
context
•	 Processing adds 
latency
•	 May lose docu­
ment coherence
•	 Large docu­
ments
•	 When context 
window is 
limited
•	 Redundant

•	 Increases out­

•	 Provides

•	 Enhances user 
confidence
•	 May reduce flu­

•	 Additional 
post-processing

•	 Complex imple­

•	 Educational 
or research 
content
•	 Legal or med­

(CRAG)
Advanced 
RAG 
techniques 
– corrective 
RAG
Evaluates 
retrieved 
documents 
and takes 
corrective 
actions (fil­
tering, web 
search)
•	 Explicitly 
handles poor 
retrieval results
•	 Improves 
robustness
•	 Can dynamical­
ly supplement 
knowledge
•	 Increased latency 
from evaluation
•	 Depends on eval­
uator accuracy
•	 More complex 
conditional logic
•	 High-reliabil­
ity require­
ments
•	 Systems need­
ing factual 
accuracy
•	 Applications 
with potential

agentic RAG
Uses auton­
omous AI 
agents to 
orchestrate 
informa­
tion gath­
ering and 
synthesis
•	 Highly adapt­
able to complex 
tasks
•	 Can use diverse 
tools beyond 
retrieval
•	 Multi-step 
reasoning capa­
bilities
•	 Significant 
implementation 
complexity
•	 Higher cost and 
latency
•	 Challenging 
to debug and
