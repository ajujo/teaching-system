You can set all your keys in the config.py file. This function, set_environment(), loads all the 
keys into the environment as mentioned. Anytime you want to run an application, you import 
the function and run it like so:
from config import set_environment
set_environment()
For production environments, consider using dedicated secrets management services or en­
vironment variables injected at runtime. These approaches provide additional security while 
maintaining the separation between code and credentials.
While OpenAI’s models remain influential, the LLM ecosystem has rapidly diversified, offering 
developers multiple options for their applications. To maintain clarity, we’ll separate LLMs from 
the model gateways that provide access to them.
