If you haven’t enabled the relevant service, you should get a helpful error message pointing you 
to the right website, where you click Enable. You have to either enable Vertex or the Generative 
Language API according to preference and availability.
LangChain offers integrations with Google services such as language model inference, embeddings, 
data ingestion from different sources, document transformation, and translation.
Other providers
•	
Replicate: You can authenticate with your GitHub credentials at https://replicate.
com/. If you then click on your user icon at the top left, you’ll find the API tokens – just 
copy the API key and make it available in your environment as REPLICATE_API_TOKEN. To 
run bigger jobs, you need to set up your credit card (under billing).
•	
Azure: By authenticating either through GitHub or Microsoft credentials, we can create 
an account on Azure at https://azure.microsoft.com/. We can then create new API 
keys under Cognitive Services | Azure OpenAI.
•	
Anthropic: You need to set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable. Please make 
sure you’ve set up billing and added funds on the Anthropic console at https://console.
anthropic.com/.
There are two main integration packages:
•	
langchain-google-vertexai
•	
langchain-google-genai
We’ll be using langchain-google-genai, the package recommended by LangChain 
for individual developers. The setup is simple, only requiring a Google account and 
API key. It is recommended to move to langchain-google-vertexai for larger 
projects. This integration offers enterprise features such as customer encryption 
keys, virtual private cloud integration, and more, requiring a Google Cloud account 
with billing.
If you’ve followed the instructions on GitHub, as indicated in the previous section, 
you should already have the langchain-google-genai package installed.
