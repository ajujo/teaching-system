Table 1.1: A timeline of major developments in language models
The field of LLMs is rapidly evolving, with multiple models competing in terms of performance, 
capabilities, and accessibility. Each provider brings distinct advantages, from OpenAI’s advanced 
general-purpose AI to Mistral’s open-weight, high-efficiency models. Understanding the dif­
ferences between these models helps practitioners make informed decisions when integrating 
LLMs into their applications.
Model comparison
The following points outline key factors to consider when comparing different LLMs, focusing 
on their accessibility, size, capabilities, and specialization:
•	
Open-source vs. closed-source models: Open-source models like Mistral and LLaMA pro­
vide transparency and the ability to run locally, while closed-source models like GPT-4 and 
Claude are accessible through APIs. Open-source LLMs can be downloaded and modified, 
enabling developers and researchers to investigate and build upon their architectures, 
though specific usage terms may apply.
•	
Size and capabilities: Larger models generally offer better performance but require more 
computational resources. This makes smaller models great for use on devices with limited 
computing power or memory, and can be significantly cheaper to use. Small language 
models (SLMs) have a relatively small number of parameters, typically using millions 
to a few billion parameters, as opposed to LLMs, which can have hundreds of billions or 
even trillions of parameters.
•	
Specialized models: Some LLMs are optimized for specific tasks, such as code generation 
(for example, Codex) or mathematical reasoning (e.g., Minerva).
