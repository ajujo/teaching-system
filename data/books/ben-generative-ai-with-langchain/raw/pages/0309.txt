User input and visualization: Google Trends and PowerBI Toolkit highlight the ecosys­
tem’s focus on bringing in external data (such as market trends) and then visualizing 
it effectively. The “human as a tool” integration is a reminder that, sometimes, human 
judgment remains indispensable, especially in ambiguous scenarios.
Having explored the theoretical framework and potential benefits of LLM-assisted software 
development, let’s now turn to practical implementation. In the following section, we’ll demon­
strate how to generate functional software code with LLMs and execute it directly from within 
the LangChain framework. This hands-on approach will illustrate the concepts we’ve discussed 
and provide you with actionable examples you can adapt to your own projects.
Writing code with LLMs 
In this section, we demonstrate code generation using various models integrated with LangChain. 
We’ve selected different models to showcase: 
•	
LangChain’s diverse integrations with AI tools 
•	
Models with different licensing and availability 
•	
Options for local deployment, including smaller models 
These examples illustrate LangChain’s flexibility in working with various code generation models, 
from cloud-based services to open-source alternatives. This approach allows you to understand 
the range of options available and choose the most suitable solution for your specific needs and 
constraints. 
Google generative AI
The Google generative AI platform offers a range of models designed for instruction following, 
conversion, and code generation/assistance. These models also have different input/output limits 
and training data and are often updated. Let’s see if the Gemini Pro model can solve FizzBuzz, a 
common interview question for entry-level software developer positions. 
Please make sure you have installed all the dependencies needed for this book, as 
explained in Chapter 2. Otherwise, you might run into issues. 
Given the pace of the field and the development of the LangChain library, we are 
making an effort to keep the GitHub repository up to date. Please see https://
github.com/benman1/generative_ai_with_langchain.
For any questions or if you have any trouble running the code, please create an issue 
on GitHub or join the discussion on Discord: https://packt.link/lang.
