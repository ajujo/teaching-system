Launch Jupyter Notebook:

This approach provides a clean, isolated environment for working with LangChain. For experi­
enced developers with established workflows, we also support:
•	
pip with venv: Instructions in the GitHub repository
•	
Docker containers: Dockerfiles provided in the GitHub repository
•	
Poetry: Configuration files available in the GitHub repository
Choose the method you’re most comfortable with but remember that all examples assume a 
Python 3.10+ environment with the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
For developers, Docker, which provides isolation via containers, is a good option. The downside 
is that it uses a lot of disk space and is more complex than the other options. For data scientists, 
I’d recommend Conda or Poetry.
Conda handles intricate dependencies efficiently, although it can be excruciatingly slow in large 
environments. Poetry resolves dependencies well and manages environments; however, it doesn’t 
capture system dependencies.
All tools allow sharing and replicating dependencies from configuration files. You can find a set 
of instructions and the corresponding configuration files in the book’s repository at https://
github.com/benman1/generative_ai_with_langchain.
Once you are finished, please make sure you have LangChain version 0.3.17 installed. You can 
check this with the command pip show langchain.
With the rapid pace of innovation in the LLM field, library updates are frequent. The 
code in this book is tested with LangChain 0.3.17, but newer versions may introduce 
changes. If you encounter any issues running the examples:
•	
Create an issue on our GitHub repository
•	
Join the discussion on Discord at https://packt.link/lang
•	
Check the errata on the book’s Packt page
This community support ensures you’ll be able to successfully implement all projects 
regardless of library updates.
