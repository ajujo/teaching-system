First Steps with LangChain

Choosing parameters for applications
For enterprise applications requiring consistency and accuracy, lower temperatures (0.0-0.3) 
combined with moderate top-p values (0.5-0.7) are typically preferred. For creative assistants or 
brainstorming tools, higher temperatures produce more diverse outputs, especially when paired 
with higher top-p values.
Remember that parameter tuning is often empirical – start with provider recommendations, then 
adjust based on your specific application needs and observed outputs.
Prompts and templates
Prompt engineering is a crucial skill for LLM application development, particularly in production 
environments. LangChain provides a robust system for managing prompts with features that 
address common development challenges:
•	
Template systems for dynamic prompt generation
•	
Prompt management and versioning for tracking changes
•	
Few-shot example management for improved model performance
•	
Output parsing and validation for reliable results
LangChain’s prompt templates transform static text into dynamic prompts with variable substi­
tution – compare these two approaches to see the key differences:
1.	
Static use – problematic at scale:
 def generate_prompt(question, context=None):
    if context:
        return f"Context information: {context}\n\nAnswer this 
question concisely: {question}"
    return f"Answer this question concisely: {question}"
      # example use:
      prompt_text = generate_prompt("What is the capital of 
France?")
2.	
PromptTemplate – production-ready:
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
# Define once, reuse everywhere
question_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( "Answer this 
question concisely: {question}" )
