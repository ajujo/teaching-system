Corrective RAG
The techniques we’ve explored so far mostly assume that our retrieval mechanism returns rel­
evant, accurate documents. But what happens when it doesn’t? In real-world applications, re­
trieval systems often return irrelevant, insufficient, or even misleading content. This “garbage 
in, garbage out” problem represents a critical vulnerability in standard RAG systems. Corrective 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CRAG) directly addresses this challenge by introducing ex­
plicit evaluation and correction mechanisms into the RAG pipeline.
CRAG extends the standard RAG pipeline with evaluation and conditional branching:
1.	
Initial retrieval: Standard document retrieval from the vector store based on the query.
2.	
Retrieval evaluation: A retrieval evaluator component assesses each document’s rele­
vance and quality.
3.	
Conditional correction:
a.	
Relevant documents: Pass high-quality documents directly to the generator.
b.	 Irrelevant documents: Filter out low-quality documents to prevent noise.
c.	
Insufficient/Ambiguous results: Trigger alternative information-seeking strat­
egies (like web search) when internal knowledge is inadequate.
4.	
Generation: Produce the final response using the filtered or augmented context.
This workflow transforms RAG from a static pipeline into a more dynamic, self-correcting system 
capable of seeking additional information when needed.
