LangChain provides frameworks for both integrated applications and autonomous agents, offer­
ing flexible components that support various architectural choices. This book will explore both 
approaches, demonstrating how to build reliable, production-ready systems that match your 
specific requirements.
Autonomous systems of agents are potentially very powerful, and it’s therefore worthwhile ex­
ploring them a bit more.
Understanding AI agents
It is sometimes joked that AI is just a fancy word for ML, or AI is ML in a suit, as illustrated in this 
image; however, there’s more to it, as we’ll see.

An AI agent represents the bridge between raw cognitive capability and practical action. While 
an LLM possesses vast knowledge and processing ability, it remains fundamentally reactive 
without agency. AI agents transform this passive capability into active utility through structured 
workflows that parse requirements, analyze options, and execute actions.
Agentic AI enables autonomous systems to make decisions and act independently, with minimal 
human intervention. Unlike deterministic systems that follow fixed rules, agentic AI relies on 
patterns and likelihoods to make informed choices. It functions through a network of autono­
mous software components called agents, which learn from user behavior and large datasets to 
improve over time.
