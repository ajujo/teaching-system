Preface
xxi
You’ll find detailed guidance on environment setup in Chapter 2, along with clear explanations 
and step-by-step instructions to help you get started. We strongly recommend following these 
setup steps as outlined—given the fast-moving nature of LangChain, LangGraph and the broader 
ecosystem, skipping them might lead to avoidable issues down the line.
Download the example code files
The code bundle for the book is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/benman1/generative_
ai_with_langchain. We recommend typing the code yourself or using the repository as you 
progress through the chapters. If there’s an update to the code, it will be updated in the GitHub 
repository.
We also have other code bundles from our rich catalog of books and videos available at https://
github.com/PacktPublishing. Check them out!

Conventions used
There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.
CodeInText: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file 
extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. For example: “Let’s also 
restore from the initial checkpoint for thread-a. We’ll see that we start with an empty history:”
A block of code is set as follows:
checkpoint_id = checkpoints[-1].config["configurable"]["checkpoint_id"]
_ = graph.invoke(
   [HumanMessage(content="test")],
   config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "thread-a", "checkpoint_id": 
checkpoint_id}})
Any command-line input or output is written as follows:
$ pip install langchain langchain-openai
Bold: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see on the screen. For instance, 
words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. For example: “ The Google Research 
team introduced the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique early in 2022.”
