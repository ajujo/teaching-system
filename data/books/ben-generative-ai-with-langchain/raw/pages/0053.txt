First Steps with LangChain
26
Setting up dependencies for this book
This book provides multiple options for running the code examples, from zero-setup cloud note­
books to local development environments. Choose the approach that best fits your experience 
level and preferences. Even if you are familiar with dependency management, please read these 
instructions since all code in this book will depend on the correct installation of the environment 
as outlined here.
For the quickest start with no local setup required, we provide ready-to-use online notebooks 
for every chapter:
•	
Google Colab: Run examples with free GPU access
•	
Kaggle Notebooks: Experiment with integrated datasets
•	
Gradient Notebooks: Access higher-performance compute options
All code examples you find in this book are available as online notebooks on GitHub at https://
github.com/benman1/generative_ai_with_langchain.
These notebooks don’t have all dependencies pre-configured but, usually, a few install commands 
get you going. These tools allow you to start experimenting immediately without worrying about 
setup. If you prefer working locally, we recommend using conda for environment management:
1.	
Install Miniconda if you don’t have it already.
2.	
Download it from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.
3.	
Create a new environment with Python 3.11:
conda create -n langchain-book python=3.11
4.	
Activate the environment:
conda activate langchain-book
5.	
Install Jupyter and core dependencies:
conda install jupyter
pip install langchain langchain-openai jupyter
Given the rapid evolution of both LangChain and the broader AI field, we maintain 
up-to-date code examples and resources in our GitHub repository: https://github.
com/benman1/generative_ai_with_langchain.
