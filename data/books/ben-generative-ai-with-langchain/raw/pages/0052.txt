First Steps with LangChain
In the previous chapter, we explored LLMs and introduced LangChain as a powerful framework 
for building LLM-powered applications. We discussed how LLMs have revolutionized natural 
language processing with their ability to understand context, generate human-like text, and 
perform complex reasoning. While these capabilities are impressive, we also examined their 
limitations—hallucinations, context constraints, and lack of up-to-date knowledge.
In this chapter, we’ll move from theory to practice by building our first LangChain application. 
We’ll start with the fundamentals: setting up a proper development environment, understanding 
LangChain’s core components, and creating simple chains. From there, we’ll explore more ad­
vanced capabilities, including running local models for privacy and cost efficiency and building 
multimodal applications that combine text with visual understanding. By the end of this chapter, 
you’ll have a solid foundation in LangChain’s building blocks and be ready to create increasingly 
sophisticated AI applications in subsequent chapters.
To sum up, this chapter will cover the following topics:
•	
Setting up dependencies
•	
Exploring LangChain’s building blocks (model interfaces, prompts and templates, and 
LCEL)
•	
Running local models
•	
Multimodal AI applications
