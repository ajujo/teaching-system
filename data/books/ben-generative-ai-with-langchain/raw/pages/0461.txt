Google
Google offers two primary platforms to access its LLMs, including the latest Gemini models:
1. Google AI platform
The Google AI platform provides a straightforward setup for developers and users, and access to 
the latest Gemini models. To use the Gemini models via Google AI:
•	
Google Account: A standard Google account is sufficient for authentication.
•	
API Key: Generate an API key to authenticate your requests.
•	
Visit this page to create your API key: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/
api-key
•	
After obtaining the API key, set the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable in your 
development environment (see the instructions for OpenAI) to authenticate your 
requests.
2. Google Cloud Vertex AI
For enterprise-level features and integration, Google’s Gemini models are available through 
Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform. To use models via Vertex AI:
1.	
Create a Google Cloud account, which requires accepting the terms of service and setting 
up billing.
2.	
Install the gcloud CLI to interact with Google Cloud services. Follow the installation 
instructions at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.
3.	
Run the following command to authenticate and obtain a key token:
gcloud auth application-default login
4.	
Ensure that the Vertex AI API is enabled for your Google Cloud project.
5.	
You can set your Google Cloud project ID – for example, using the gcloud command:
gcloud config set project my-project
Other methods are passing a constructor argument when initializing the LLM, using aiplatform.
init(), or setting a GCP environment variable.
You can read more about these options in the Vertex documentation.
