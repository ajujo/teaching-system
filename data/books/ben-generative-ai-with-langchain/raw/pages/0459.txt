Here’s how this should look on the OpenAI platform:
Figure A.1: OpenAI API platform – Create new secret key
After clicking Create secret key, you should see the message API key generated. You need to copy 
the key to your clipboard and save it, as you will need it. You can set the key as an environment 
variable (OPENAI_API_KEY) or pass it as a parameter every time you construct a class for Ope­
nAI calls.
You can specify different models when you initialize your model, be it a chat model or an LLM. 
You can see a list of models at https://platform.openai.com/docs/models.
OpenAI provides a comprehensive suite of capabilities that integrate seamlessly with LangChain, 
including:
•	
Core language models via the OpenAI API
•	
Embedding class for text embedding models
We’ll cover the basics of model integration in this chapter, while deeper explorations of specialized 
features like embeddings, assistants, and moderation will follow in Chapters 4 and 5.
