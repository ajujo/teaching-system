Text-to-image
LangChain integrates with various image generation models and services, allowing you to:
•	
Generate images from text descriptions
•	
Edit existing images based on text prompts
•	
Control image generation parameters
•	
Handle image variations and styles
LangChain includes wrappers and models for popular image generation services. First, let’s see 
how to generate images with OpenAI’s DALL-E model series.
Using DALL-E through OpenAI
LangChain’s wrapper for DALL-E simplifies the process of generating images from text prompts. 
The implementation uses OpenAI’s API under the hood but provides a standardized interface 
consistent with other LangChain components.
from langchain_community.utilities.dalle_image_generator import 
DallEAPIWrapper
dalle = DallEAPIWrapper(
   model_name="dall-e-3",  # Options: "dall-e-2" (default) or "dall-e-3"
   size="1024x1024",       # Image dimensions
    quality="standard",     # "standard" or "hd" for DALL-E 3
    n=1                     # Number of images to generate (only for 
DALL-E 2)
)
# Generate an image
image_url = dalle.run("A detailed technical diagram of a quantum 
computer")
# Display the image in a notebook
from IPython.display import Image, display
display(Image(url=image_url))
# Or save it locally
import requests
response = requests.get(image_url)
