Software Development and Data 
Analysis Agents
This chapter explores how natural language—our everyday English or whatever language you 
prefer to interact in with an LLM—has emerged as a powerful interface for programming, a par­
adigm shift that, when taken to its extreme, is called vibe coding. Instead of learning acquiring 
new programming languages or frameworks, developers can now articulate their intent in natural 
language, leaving it to advanced LLMs and frameworks such as LangChain to translate these ideas 
into robust, production-ready code. Moreover, while traditional programming languages remain 
essential for production systems, LLMs are creating new workflows that complement existing 
practices and potentially increase accessibility This evolution represents a significant shift from 
earlier attempts at code generation and automation.
We’ll specifically discuss LLMs’ place in software development and the state of the art of perfor­
mance, models, and applications. We’ll see how to use LLM chains and agents to help in code 
generation and data analysis, training ML models, and extracting predictions. We’ll cover writing 
code with LLMs, giving examples with different models be it on Google’s generative AI services, 
Hugging Face, or Anthropic. After this, we’ll move on to more advanced approaches with agents 
and RAG for documentation or a code repository.
We’ll also be applying LLM agents to data science: we’ll first train a model on a dataset, then we’ll 
analyze and visualize a dataset. Whether you’re a developer, a data scientist, or a technical deci­
sion-maker, this chapter will equip you with a clear understanding of how LLMs are reshaping 
software development and data analysis while maintaining the essential role of conventional 
programming languages.
