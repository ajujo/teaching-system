Building Intelligent RAG Systems
160
For technical or specialized domains with complex terminology, hybrid retrieval provides a strong 
foundation by capturing both semantic relationships and exact terminology. When dealing with 
lengthy documents where only portions are relevant, add contextual compression to extract the 
most pertinent sections.
For applications where accuracy and transparency are critical, implement source attribution 
and self-consistency checking to ensure that generated responses are faithful to the retrieved 
information. If users frequently submit ambiguous or poorly formulated queries, query transfor­
mation techniques can help bridge the gap between user language and document terminology.
So when should you choose each approach?
•	
Start with naive RAG for quick prototyping and simple question-answering
•	
Add hybrid retrieval when facing vocabulary mismatch issues or mixed content types
•	
Implement re-ranking when the initial retrieval quality needs refinement
•	
Use query transformation for complex queries or when users struggle to articulate in­
formation needs
•	
Apply context processing when dealing with limited context windows or redundant in­
formation
•	
Add response enhancement for applications requiring high trustworthiness and attri­
bution
•	
Consider CRAG when reliability and factual accuracy are mission-critical
In practice, production RAG systems often combine multiple approaches. For example, a robust 
enterprise system might use hybrid retrieval with query transformation, apply context processing 
to optimize the retrieved information, enhance responses with source attribution, and implement 
CRAG’s evaluation layer for critical applications.
Start with implementing one or two key techniques that address your most pressing challenges, 
then measure their impact on performance metrics like relevance, accuracy, and user satisfaction. 
Add additional techniques incrementally as needed, always considering the tradeoff between 
improved results and increased computational costs.
To demonstrate a RAG system in practice, in the next section, we’ll walk through the implemen­
tation of a chatbot that retrieves and integrates external knowledge into responses.
