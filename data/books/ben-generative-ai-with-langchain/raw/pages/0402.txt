LangGraph applications differ from simple LangChain chains in several important ways that 
affect deployment:
•	
State persistence: Maintain execution state across steps, requiring persistent storage.
•	
Complex execution flows: Support for conditional routing and loops requires specialized 
orchestration.
•	
Multi-component coordination: Manage communication between various agents and 
tools.
•	
Visualization and debugging: Understand complex graph execution patterns.
The LangGraph ecosystem provides tools specifically designed to address these challenges, making 
it easier to deploy sophisticated multi-agent systems to production. Moreover, LangGraph offers 
several deployment options to suit different requirements. Let’s go over them!
Local development with the LangGraph CLI
Before deploying to production, the LangGraph CLI provides a streamlined environment for local 
development and testing. Install the LangGraph CLI:
pip install --upgrade "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
Create a new application from a template:
langgraph new path/to/your/app --template react-agent-python
This creates a project structure like so:
my-app/
├── my_agent/                # All project code
│   ├── utils/               # Utilities for your graph
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── tools.py         # Tool definitions
│   │   ├── nodes.py         # Node functions
│   │   └── state.py         # State definition
│   ├── requirements.txt     # Package dependencies
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── agent.py             # Graph construction code
├── .env                     # Environment variables
└── langgraph.json           # LangGraph configuration
