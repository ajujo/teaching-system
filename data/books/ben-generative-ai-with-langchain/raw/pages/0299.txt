This evolution has been characterized by parallel development tracks in both proprietary and 
open-source ecosystems. Initially, commercial models dominated the landscape, but open-source 
alternatives have gained substantial momentum more recently. Throughout this progression, sev­
eral key milestones have marked transformative shifts in capabilities, opening new possibilities 
for AI-assisted development across different programming languages and tasks. The historical 
context of this evolution provides important insights for understanding implementation ap­
proaches with LangChain. 
Figure 7.1: Evolution of code LLMs (2021–2024)
Figure 7.1 illustrates the progression of code-specialized language models across commercial (upper 
track) and open-source (lower track) ecosystems. Key milestones are highlighted, showing the 
transition from early proof-of-concept models to increasingly specialized solutions. The timeline 
spans from early commercial models such as Codex to recent advancements such as Google’s 
Gemini 2.5 Pro (March 2025) and specialized code models such as Mistral AI’s Codestral series. 
In recent years, we’ve witnessed an explosion of LLMs fine-tuned specifically tailored for cod­
ing—commonly known as code LLMs. These models are rapidly evolving, each with its own 
set of strengths and limitations, and are reshaping the software development landscape. They 
offer the promise of accelerating development workflows across a broad spectrum of software 
engineering tasks:
•	
Code generation: Transforming natural language requirements into code snippets or 
full functions. For instance, developers can generate boilerplate code or entire modules 
based on project specifications.
