The Rise of Generative AI: From Language Models to Agents
20
LangChain’s package architecture evolved as a direct response to scaling challenges. As the frame­
work rapidly expanded to support hundreds of integrations, the original monolithic structure 
became unsustainable—forcing users to install unnecessary dependencies, creating maintenance 
bottlenecks, and hindering contribution accessibility. By dividing into specialized packages with 
lazy loading of dependencies, LangChain elegantly solved these issues while preserving a cohesive 
ecosystem. This architecture allows developers to import only what they need, reduces version 
conflicts, enables independent release cycles for stable versus experimental features, and dramat­
ically simplifies the contribution path for community developers working on specific integrations.
The LangChain codebase follows a well-organized structure that separates concerns while main­
taining a cohesive ecosystem:
Core structure
•	
docs/: Documentation resources for developers
•	
libs/: Contains all library packages in the monorepo
Library organization
•	
langchain-core/: Foundational abstractions and interfaces that define the framework
•	
langchain/: The main implementation library with core components:
•	
vectorstores/: Integrations with vector databases (Pinecone, Chroma, etc.)
•	
chains/: Pre-built chain implementations for common workflows
Other component directories for retrievers, embeddings, etc.
•	
langchain-experimental/: Cutting-edge features still under development
•	
langchain-community: Houses third-party integrations maintained by the LangChain 
community. This includes most integrations for components like LLMs, vector stores, and 
retrievers. Dependencies are optional to maintain a lightweight package.
•	
Partner packages: Popular integrations are separated into dedicated packages (e.g., lang­
chain-openai, langchain-anthropic) to enhance independent support. These packages 
reside outside the LangChain repository but within the GitHub “langchain-ai” organiza­
tion (see github.com/orgs/langchain-ai). A full list is available at python.langchain.
