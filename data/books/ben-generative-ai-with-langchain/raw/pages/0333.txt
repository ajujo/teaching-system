In the repository, you can see a UI that wraps a data science agent. 
Data science agents represent a powerful application of LangChain’s capabilities. These agents can:
•	
Generate and execute Python code for data analysis and machine learning
•	
Build and train models based on simple natural language instructions
•	
Answer complex questions about datasets through analysis and visualization
•	
Automate repetitive data science tasks
While these agents aren’t yet ready to replace human data scientists, they can significantly accel­
erate workflows by handling routine tasks and providing quick insights from data.
Let’s conclude the chapter!
Summary
This chapter has examined how LLMs are reshaping software development and data analysis 
practices through natural language interfaces. We traced the evolution from early code genera­
tion models to today’s sophisticated systems, analyzing benchmarks that reveal both capabilities 
and limitations. Independent research suggests that while 55% productivity gains in controlled 
settings don’t fully translate to production environments, meaningful improvements of 4-22% 
are still being realized, particularly when human expertise guides LLM implementation.
