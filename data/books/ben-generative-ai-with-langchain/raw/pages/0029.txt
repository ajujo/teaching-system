The modern LLM landscape
Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been a subject of fascination and research, but recent advance­
ments in generative AI have propelled it into mainstream adoption. Unlike traditional AI systems 
that classify data or make predictions, generative AI can create new content—text, images, code, 
and more—by leveraging vast amounts of training data.
The generative AI revolution was catalyzed by the 2017 introduction of the transformer architec­
ture, which enabled models to process text with unprecedented understanding of context and 
relationships. As researchers scaled these models from millions to billions of parameters, they 
discovered something remarkable: larger models didn’t just perform incrementally better—they 
exhibited entirely new emergent capabilities like few-shot learning, complex reasoning, and 
creative generation that weren’t explicitly programmed. Eventually, the release of ChatGPT in 
2022 marked a turning point, demonstrating these capabilities to the public and sparking wide­
spread adoption.
The landscape shifted again with the open-source revolution led by models like Llama and Mistral, 
democratizing access to powerful AI beyond the major tech companies. However, these advanced 
capabilities came with significant limitations—models couldn’t reliably use tools, reason through 
complex problems, or maintain context across interactions. This gap between raw model power 
and practical utility created the need for specialized frameworks like LangChain that transform 
these models from impressive text generators into functional, production-ready agents capable 
of solving real-world problems.
