These are the chunks:
['# Introduction to RAG\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines 
retrieval systems with generative AI models. It helps address 
hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved information. ## Key 
Components\nRAG consists of several components:\n1. Document processing\
n2. Vector embedding\n3. Retrieval\n4.',
 'Augmentation\n5. Generation\n\n### Document Processing\nThis step 
involves loading and chunking documents appropriately. ']
Here’s how the SemanticChunker works:
1.	
Splits text into sentences
2.	
Creates embeddings for groups of sentences (determined by buffer_size)
3.	
Measures semantic similarity between adjacent groups
4.	
Identifies natural breakpoints where topics or concepts change
5.	
Creates chunks that preserve semantic coherence
You may use semantic chunking for complex technical documents where semantic cohesion 
is crucial for accurate retrieval and when you’re willing to spend additional compute/costs on 
embedding generation.
Benefits include chunk creation based on actual meaning rather than superficial text features 
and keeping related concepts together even when they span traditional separator boundaries.
Agent-based chunking
This experimental approach uses LLMs to intelligently divide text based on semantic analysis 
and content understanding in the following manner:
1.	
Analyze the document’s structure and content
2.	
Identify natural breakpoints based on topic shifts
3.	
Determine optimal chunk boundaries that preserve meaning
4.	
Return a list of starting positions for creating chunks
This type of chunking can be useful for exceptionally complex documents where standard splitting 
methods fail to preserve critical relationships between concepts. This approach is particularly 
useful when:
•	
Documents contain intricate logical flows that need to be preserved
