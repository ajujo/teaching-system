These developments challenge the simple scaling hypothesis by demonstrating that qualitative 
architectural innovations and novel training approaches can yield discontinuous improvements 
in capabilities. They suggest that the future of AI advancement may depend more on how mod­
els are structured to think than on raw parameter counts—a theme we’ll explore further in the 
Limitations of scaling section.
The following tracks the progress of AI systems across various capabilities relative to human 
performance over a 25-year period. Human performance serves as the baseline (set to zero on 
the vertical axis), while each AI capability’s initial performance is normalized to -100. The chart 
reveals the varying trajectories and timelines for different AI capabilities reaching and exceeding 
human-level performance. Note the particularly steep improvement curve for predictive reason­
ing, suggesting this capability remains in a phase of rapid advancement rather than plateauing. 
Reading comprehension, language understanding, and image recognition all crossed the human 
performance threshold between approximately 2015 and 2020, while handwriting and speech 
recognition achieved this milestone earlier.
The comparison between human cognition and generative AI reveals several fundamental differ­
ences that persist despite remarkable progress between 2022 and 2025. Here is a table summa­
rizing the key strengths and deficiencies of current generative AI compared to human cognition:
Category
Human Cognition
Generative AI
Conceptual 
understanding
Forms causal models grounded 
in physical and social experience; 
builds meaningful concept 
relationships beyond statistical 
patterns
Relies primarily on statistical pattern 
recognition without true causal 
understanding; can manipulate 
symbols fluently without deeper 
semantic comprehension
Factual 
processing
Integrates knowledge with 
significant cognitive biases; 
susceptible to various reasoning 
errors while maintaining functional 
reliability for survival
Produces confident but often 
hallucinated information; struggles 
to distinguish reliable from 
unreliable information despite 
retrieval augmentation
Adaptive 
learning and 
reasoning
Slow acquisition of complex 
skills but highly sample-efficient; 
transfers strategies across domains 
using analogical thinking; can 
generalize from a few examples 
within familiar contexts
Requires massive datasets for initial 
training; reasoning abilities strongly 
bound by training distribution; 
increasingly capable of in-context 
learning but struggles with truly 
novel domains
