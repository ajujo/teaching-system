Interactive interface: Integrates the pipeline with Gradio for real-time user interactions
Let’s get started! Each file in the project serves a specific role in the overall documentation chatbot. 
Let’s first look at document loading.
Document loading
The main purpose of this module is to give an interface to read different document formats.
While this chapter provides a brief overview of performance measurements and 
evaluation metrics, an in-depth discussion of performance and observability will 
be covered in Chapter 8. Please make sure you have installed all the dependencies 
needed for this book, as explained in Chapter 2. Otherwise, you might run into issues.
Additionally, given the pace of the field and the development of the LangChain li­
brary, we are making an effort to keep the GitHub repository up to date. Please see 
https://github.com/benman1/generative_ai_with_langchain.
For any questions, or if you have any trouble running the code, please create an issue 
on GitHub or join the discussion on Discord: https://packt.link/lang.
The Document class in LangChain is a fundamental data structure for storing and 
manipulating text content along with associated metadata. It stores text content 
through its required page_content parameter along with optional metadata stored 
as a dictionary.
The class also supports an optional id parameter that ideally should be formatted as 
a UUID to uniquely identify documents across collections, though this isn’t strictly 
enforced. Documents can be created by simply passing content and metadata, as 
in this example:
Document(page_content="Hello, world!", metadata={"source": 
"https://example.com"})
This interface serves as the standard representation of text data throughout LangC­
hain’s document processing pipelines, enabling consistent handling during loading, 
splitting, transformation, and retrieval operations.
