Choosing the right techniques
When implementing advanced RAG techniques, consider the specific requirements and constraints 
of your application. To guide your decision-making process, the following table provides a com­
prehensive comparison of RAG approaches discussed throughout this chapter:

– hybrid 
retrieval
Combines 
sparse 
(BM25) 
and dense 
(vector) 
retrieval 
methods
•	 Balances key­
word precision 
with semantic 
understanding
•	 Handles vocab­
ulary mismatch
•	 Improves recall 
without sacri­
ficing precision
•	 Increased system 
complexity
•	 Challenge in 
optimizing fusion 
weights
•	 Higher computa­
tional overhead
•	 Technical doc­
umentation
•	 Content with 
specialized 
terminology
•	 Multi-domain 
knowledge 
bases

results with 
more so­
phisticated

models
•	 Improves result 
ordering
•	 Captures nu­
anced relevance 
signals
•	 Can be applied 
to any retrieval 
method
•	 Additional com­
putation layer
•	 May create bot­
tlenecks for large 
result sets
•	 Requires training 
or configuring 
re-rankers
•	 When retrieval 
quality is 
critical
•	 For handling 
ambiguous 
queries
•	 High-value 
information 
needs

Generates

query for 
improved 
retrieval
•	 Bridges que­
ry-document

•	 Handles implic­
it information 
needs
•	 Additional LLM 
generation step
•	 Depends on
