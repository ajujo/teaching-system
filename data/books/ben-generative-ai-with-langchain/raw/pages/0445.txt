Open-source and synthetic data: High-quality public datasets that enable collaboration 
and enhance privacy while reducing bias
•	
Federated learning: Training on decentralized data to improve privacy while benefiting 
from diverse sources
•	
Multimodality: Integration of language with image, video, and other modalities in top 
models
Among the technical advancements helping to drive down costs, quantization techniques have 
emerged as an essential contributor. Open-source datasets and techniques such as synthetic data 
generation further democratize access to AI training by providing high-quality and data-efficient 
model development and removing some reliance on vast, proprietary datasets. Open-source ini­
tiatives contribute to the trend by providing cost-effective, collaborative platforms for innovation.
These innovations collectively lower barriers that have so far impeded real-world generative AI 
adoption in several important ways:
•	
Financial barriers are reduced by compressing large model performance into far smaller 
form factors through quantization and distillation
•	
Privacy considerations can potentially be addressed through synthetic data techniques, 
though reliable, reproducible implementations of federated learning for LLMs specifically 
remain an area of ongoing research rather than proven methodology
•	
The accuracy limitations hampering small models are relieved through grounding gen­
eration with external information
•	
Specialized hardware significantly accelerates throughput while optimized software max­
imizes existing infrastructure efficiency
By democratizing access by tackling constraints like cost, security, and reliability, these approach­
es unlock benefits for vastly expanded audiences, steering generative creativity from a narrow 
concentration toward empowering diverse human talents.
The landscape is shifting from a focus on sheer model size and brute-force compute to clever, nu­
anced approaches that maximize computational efficiency and model efficacy. With quantization 
and related techniques lowering barriers, we’re poised for a more diverse and dynamic era of AI 
development where resource wealth is not the only determinant of leadership in AI innovation.
