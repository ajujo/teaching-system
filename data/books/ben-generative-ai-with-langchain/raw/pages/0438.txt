Second, the competitive landscape has shifted dramatically. The once-clear technological 
lead of companies like OpenAI has eroded, with 7-10 GPT-4 level models now available 
in the market. Chinese companies like DeepSeek have achieved comparable performance 
with dramatically less compute (as little as 1/50th of the training costs), challenging the 
notion that massive resource advantage translates to insurmountable technological leads.

Third, economic unsustainability has become apparent. The scaling approach has led to 
enormous costs without proportional revenue. Price wars have erupted as competitors 
with similar capabilities undercut each other, compressing margins and eroding the eco­
nomic case for ever-larger models.
•	
Finally, industry recognition of these limitations has grown. Key industry figures, includ­
ing Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and prominent investors like Marc Andreessen, have 
publicly acknowledged that scaling laws may be hitting a ceiling, similar to how Moore’s 
Law eventually slowed down in chip manufacturing.
Big tech vs. small enterprises
The rise of open source AI has been particularly transformative in this shifting landscape. Projects 
like Llama, Mistral, and others have democratized access to powerful foundation models, allowing 
smaller companies to build, fine-tune, and deploy their own LLMs without the massive invest­
ments previously required. This open source ecosystem has created fertile ground for innovation 
where specialized, domain-specific models developed by smaller teams can outperform general 
models from tech giants in specific applications, further eroding the advantages of scale alone. 
Several smaller companies have demonstrated this dynamic successfully. Cohere, with a team a 
fraction of the size of Google or OpenAI, has developed specialized enterprise-focused models 
that match or exceed larger competitors in business applications through innovative training 
methodologies focused on instruction-following and reliability. Similarly, Anthropic achieved 
command performance with Claude models that often outperformed larger competitors in rea­
soning and safety benchmarks by emphasizing constitutional AI approaches rather than just scale. 
In the open-source realm, Mistral AI has repeatedly shown that their carefully designed smaller 
models can achieve performance competitive with models many times their size.
What’s becoming increasingly evident is that the once-clear technological moat enjoyed by Big 
Tech firms is rapidly eroding. The competitive landscape has dramatically shifted in 2024-2025.
Multiple capable models have emerged. Where OpenAI once stood alone with ChatGPT and GPT-
4, there are now 7-10 comparable models available in the market from companies like Anthropic, 
Google, Meta, Mistral, and DeepSeek, significantly reducing OpenAI’s perceived uniqueness and 
technological advantage.
