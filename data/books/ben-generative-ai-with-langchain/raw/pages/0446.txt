New scaling laws for post-training phases
Unlike traditional pre-training scaling, where performance improvements eventually plateau 
with increased parameter count, reasoning performance consistently improves with more time 
spent thinking during inference. Several studies indicate that allowing models more time to work 
through complex problems step by step could enhance their problem-solving capabilities in 
certain domains. This approach, sometimes called inference-time scaling, is still an evolving area 
of research with promising initial results.
This emerging scaling dynamic suggests that while pre-training scaling may be approaching 
diminishing returns, post-training and inference-time scaling represent promising new frontiers. 
The relationship between these scaling laws and instruction-following capabilities is particularly 
notable—models must have sufficiently strong instruction-following abilities to demonstrate 
these test-time scaling benefits. This creates a compelling case for concentrating research efforts 
on enhancing inference-time reasoning rather than simply expanding model size.
Having examined the technical limitations of scaling and the emerging alternatives, we now turn 
to the economic consequences of these developments. As we’ll see, the shift from pure scaling to 
more efficient approaches has significant implications for market dynamics, investment patterns, 
and value creation opportunities.
Economic and industry transformation
Integrating generative AI promises immense productivity gains through automating tasks across 
sectors, while potentially causing workforce disruptions due to the pace of change. According to 
PwC’s 2023 Global Artificial Intelligence Impact Index and JPMorgan’s 2024 The Economic Impact 
of Generative AI reports, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, 
boosting global GDP by up to 14%. This economic impact will be unevenly distributed, with China 
potentially seeing a 26% GDP boost and North America around 14%. The sectors expected to see 
the highest impact include (in order):
•	
Healthcare
•	
Automotive
•	
Financial services
•	
Transportation and logistics
JPM’s report highlights that AI is more than simple automation—it fundamentally enhances 
business capabilities. Future gains will likely spread across the economy as technology sector 
leadership evolves and innovations diffuse throughout various industries.
