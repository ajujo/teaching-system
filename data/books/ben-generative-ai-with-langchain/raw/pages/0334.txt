Chapter 7
307
Our practical demonstrations illustrated diverse approaches to LLM integration through LangC­
hain. We used multiple models to generate code solutions, built RAG systems to augment LLMs 
with documentation and repository knowledge, and created agents capable of training neural 
networks and analyzing datasets with minimal human intervention. Throughout these imple­
mentations, we looked at critical security considerations, providing validation frameworks and 
risk mitigation strategies essential for production deployments. 
Having explored the capabilities and integration strategies for LLMs in software and data work­
flows, we now turn our attention to ensuring these solutions work reliably in production. In 
Chapter 8, we’ll delve into evaluation and testing methodologies that help validate AI-generated 
code and safeguard system performance, setting the stage for building truly production-ready 
applications.
Questions
1.	
What is vibe coding, and how does it change the traditional approach to writing and 
maintaining code?
2.	 What key differences exist between traditional low-code platforms and LLM-based de­
velopment approaches?
3.	
How do independent research findings on productivity gains from AI coding assistants 
differ from vendor claims, and what factors might explain this discrepancy?
4.	
What specific benchmark metrics show that LLMs struggle more with class-level code 
generation compared to function-level tasks, and why is this distinction important for 
practical implementations?
5.	
Describe the validation framework presented in the chapter for LLM-generated code. What 
are the six key areas of assessment, and why is each important for production systems?
6.	
Using the repository RAG example from the chapter, explain how you would modify the 
implementation to better handle large codebases with thousands of files.
7.	
What patterns emerged in the dataset analysis examples that demonstrate how LLMs 
perform in structured data analysis tasks versus unstructured text processing?
8.	 How does the agentic approach to data science, as demonstrated in the neural network 
training example, differ from traditional programming workflows? What advantages and 
limitations did this approach reveal?
