Evaluation and Testing
312
Manufacturing contexts require alignment evaluation focused on safety parameters and opera­
tional boundaries. AI systems must recognize potentially dangerous operations, maintain appro­
priate human intervention protocols for quality control, and adhere to industry safety standards. 
Alignment evaluation includes testing whether predictive maintenance systems appropriately 
escalate critical safety issues to human technicians rather than autonomously deciding mainte­
nance schedules for safety-critical equipment.
In educational settings, alignment evaluation must consider developmental appropriateness 
across student age groups, fair assessment standards across diverse student populations, and ap­
propriate transparency levels. Educational AI systems require evaluation of their ability to provide 
balanced perspectives on complex topics, avoid reinforcing stereotypes in learning examples, and 
appropriately defer to human educators on sensitive or nuanced issues. These domain-specific 
alignment evaluations are essential for ensuring AI systems not only perform well technically 
but also operate within appropriate ethical and safety boundaries for their application context.
Performance and efficiency
Like early challenges in software testing that were resolved through standardized practices, agent 
evaluations face similar hurdles. These include:
•	
Overfitting: Where systems perform well only on test data but not in real-world situations
•	
Gaming benchmarks: Optimizing for specific test scenarios rather than general perfor­
mance
•	
Insufficient diversity in evaluation datasets: Failing to test performance across the 
breadth of real-world situations the system will encounter, including edge cases and 
unexpected inputs
Drawing lessons from software testing and other domains, comprehensive evaluation frame­
works need to measure not only the accuracy but also the scalability, resource utilization, and 
safety of LLM agents.
Performance evaluation determines whether agents can reliably achieve their intended goals, in­
cluding:
•	
Accuracy in task completion across varied scenarios
•	
Robustness when handling novel inputs that differ from evaluation examples
•	
Resistance to adversarial inputs or manipulation
•	
Resource efficiency in computational and operational costs
