The workflow in a RAG system follows a clear sequence: when a query arrives, it’s processed for 
retrieval; the retriever then searches the knowledge base for relevant information; this retrieved 
context is combined with the original query through augmentation; finally, the language model 
generates a response grounded in both the query and the retrieved information. We can see this 
in the following diagram:
