With just a few lines of code, we’ve successfully extended our LLM’s capabilities to work with 
complex numbers. Now we can put together the example we started with:
question = "What is a square root of the current US president's age 
multiplied by 132?"
system_hint = "Think step-by-step. Always use search to get the fresh 
information about events or public facts that can change over time."
agent = create_react_agent(
   llm, [calculator, search],
   state_modifier=system_hint)
for event in agent.stream({"messages": [("user", question)]}, stream_
mode="values"):
   event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
print(event["messages"][-1].content)
>> The square root of Donald Trump's age multiplied by 132 is 
approximately 101.47.
We haven’t provided the full output here in the book (you can find it on our GitHub), but if you 
run this snippet, you should see that the LLM was able to query tools step by step:
1.	
It called the search engine with the query "current US president".
