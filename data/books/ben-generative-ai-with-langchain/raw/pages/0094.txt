Building Workflows with 
LangGraph
So far, we’ve learned about LLMs, LangChain as a framework, and how to use LLMs with LangC­
hain in a vanilla mode (just asking to generate a text output based on a prompt). In this chapter, 
we’ll start with a quick introduction to LangGraph as a framework and how to develop more 
complex workflows with LangChain and LangGraph by chaining together multiple steps. As an 
example, we’ll discuss parsing LLM outputs and look into error handling patterns with LangChain 
and LangGraph. Then, we’ll continue with more advanced ways to develop prompts and explore 
what building blocks LangChain offers for few-shot prompting and other techniques. 
We’re also going to cover working with multimodal inputs, utilizing the long context, and ad­
justing your workloads to overcome limitations related to the context window size. Finally, we’ll 
look into the basic mechanisms of managing memory with LangChain. Understanding these 
fundamental and key techniques will help us read LangGraph code, understand tutorials and 
code samples, and develop our own complex workflows. We’ll, of course, discuss what LangGraph 
workflows are and will continue building on that skill in Chapters 5 and 6.
In a nutshell, we’ll cover the following main topics in this chapter:
•	
LangGraph fundamentals
•	
Prompt engineering
•	
Working with short context windows
•	
Understanding memory mechanisms
