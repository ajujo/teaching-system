We should get a response like this:
{
    "claims": [
        {
            "claim": "The transformer architecture was introduced by 
OpenAI in 2018",
            "status": "contradicted",
            "evidence": "The transformer architecture was introduced in 
the paper 'Attention is All You Need' by Vaswani et al. in 2017.",
            "explanation": "The claim is contradicted by the fact that the 
transformer architecture was introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al., not by 
OpenAI in 2018."
        },
        {
            "claim": "The transformer architecture uses recurrent neural 
networks",
            "status": "contradicted",
            "evidence": "It relies on self-attention mechanisms instead of 
recurrent or convolutional neural networks.",
            "explanation": "The claim is contradicted by the fact that the 
transformer architecture does not use recurrent neural networks but relies 
on self-attention mechanisms."

            "claim": "BERT is a transformer model developed by Google",
            "status": "fully_supported",
            "evidence": "BERT is a transformer-based model developed by 
Google that uses masked language modeling and next sentence prediction as 
pre-training objectives.",
