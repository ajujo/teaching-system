•	
Google Cloud Run: Supports containerized LangChain applications with automatic scaling
•	
Azure Functions: Similar to AWS Lambda but in the Microsoft ecosystem
These platforms automatically handle scaling based on traffic and typically offer a pay-per-use 
pricing model, which can be cost-effective for applications with variable traffic patterns.
UI frameworks
These tools help build interfaces for your LangChain applications:
•	
Chainlit: Specifically designed for deploying LangChain agents with interactive ChatGPT-
like UIs. Key features include intermediary step visualization, element management and 
display (images, text, carousel), and cloud deployment options.
•	
Gradio: An easy-to-use library for creating customizable UIs for ML models and LangChain 
applications, with simple deployment to Hugging Face Spaces.
•	
Streamlit: A popular framework for creating data apps and LLM interfaces, as we’ve seen 
in earlier chapters. We discussed working with Streamlit in Chapter 4.
•	
Mesop: A modular, low-code UI builder tailored for LangChain, offering drag-and-drop 
components, built-in theming, plugin support, and real-time collaboration for rapid in­
terface development.
These frameworks provide the user-facing layer that connects to your LangChain backend, making 
your applications accessible to end users.
Model Context Protocol
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging open standard designed to standardize how 
LLM applications interact with external tools, structured data, and predefined prompts. As dis­
cussed throughout this book, the real-world utility of LLMs and agents often depends on accessing 
external data sources, APIs, and enterprise tools. MCP, developed by Anthropic, addresses this 
challenge by standardizing AI interactions with external systems.
This is particularly relevant for LangChain deployments, which frequently involve interactions 
between LLMs and various external resources.
MCP follows a client-server architecture:
•	
The MCP client is embedded in the AI application (like your LangChain app).
•	
The MCP server acts as an intermediary to external resources.
