Advanced Applications and Multi-Agent Systems
228
We will look into a few core agentic architectures in the remainder of this chapter, and intro­
duce some important LangGraph interfaces (such as streaming details and handoffs) that are 
useful to develop agents. If you’re interested, you can find more examples and tutorials on the 
LangChain documentation page at https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/
agentic_concepts/. We’ll begin with discussing the importance of specialization in multi-agentic 
systems, including what the consensus mechanism is and the different consensus mechanisms.
Agent roles and specialization
When working on a complex task, we as humans know that usually, it’s beneficial to have a team 
with diverse skills and backgrounds. There is much evidence from research and experiments that 
suggests this is also true for generative AI agents. In fact, developing specialized agents offers 
several advantages for complex AI systems.
First, specialization improves performance on specific tasks. This allows you to:
•	
Select the optimal set of tools for each task type.
•	
Craft tailored prompts and workflows.
•	
Fine-tune hyperparameters such as temperature for specific contexts.
Second, specialized agents help manage complexity. Current LLMs struggle when handling too 
many tools at once. As a best practice, limit each agent to 5-15 different tools, rather than overload­
ing a single agent with all available tools. How to group tools is still an open question; typically, 
grouping them into toolkits to create coherent specialized agents helps.
