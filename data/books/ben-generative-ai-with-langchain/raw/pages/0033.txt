The Rise of Generative AI: From Language Models to Agents
6
Let’s now discuss a comparative overview of various LLMs, highlighting their key characteristics 
and differentiating factors. We’ll delve into aspects such as open-source vs. closed-source models, 
model size and capabilities, and specialized models. By understanding these distinctions, you 
can select the most suitable LLM for your specific needs and applications.
LLM provider landscape
You can access LLMs from major providers like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, along with a 
growing number of others, through their websites or APIs. As the demand for LLMs grows, nu­
merous providers have entered the space, each offering models with unique capabilities and 
trade-offs. Developers need to understand the various access options available for integrating 
these powerful models into their applications. The choice of provider will significantly impact 
development experience, performance characteristics, and operational costs.
The table below provides a comparative overview of leading LLM providers and examples of the 
models they offer:
