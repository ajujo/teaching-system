The Future of Generative Models: Beyond Scaling
412
Price wars and commoditization have intensified. As capabilities have equalized, providers have 
engaged in aggressive price cutting. OpenAI has repeatedly lowered prices in response to com­
petitive pressure, particularly from Chinese companies offering similar capabilities at lower costs.
Non-traditional players have demonstrated rapid catch-up. Companies like DeepSeek and By­
teDance have achieved comparable model quality with dramatically lower training costs, demon­
strating that innovative training methodologies can overcome resource disparities. Additionally, 
innovation cycles have shortened considerably. New technical advances are being matched or 
surpassed within weeks or months rather than years, making any technological lead increasingly 
temporary.
Looking at the technology adoption landscape, we can consider two primary scenarios for AI 
implementation. In the centralized scenario, generative AI and LLMs are primarily developed 
and controlled by large tech firms that invest heavily in the necessary computational hardware, 
data storage, and specialized AI/ML talent. These entities produce general proprietary models 
that are often made accessible to customers through cloud services or APIs, but these one-size-
fits-all solutions may not perfectly align with the requirements of every user or organization.
Conversely, in the self-service scenario, companies or individuals take on the task of fine-tuning 
their own AI models. This approach allows them to create models that are customized to the spe­
cific needs and proprietary data of the user, providing more targeted and relevant functionality. 
As costs decline for computing, data storage, and AI talent, custom fine-tuning of specialized 
models is already feasible for small and mid-sized companies.
A hybrid landscape is likely to emerge where both approaches fulfill distinct roles based on use 
cases, resources, expertise, and privacy considerations. Large firms might continue to excel in 
providing industry-specific models, while smaller entities could increasingly fine-tune their own 
models to meet niche demands.
If robust tools emerge to simplify and automate AI development, custom generative models may 
even be viable for local governments, community groups, and individuals to address hyper-local 
challenges. While large tech firms currently dominate generative AI research and development, 
smaller entities may ultimately stand to gain the most from these technologies.
