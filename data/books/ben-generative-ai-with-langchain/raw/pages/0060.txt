# Either one or both can be used with the same interface
response = openai_llm.invoke("Tell me a joke about light bulbs!")
print(response)
Please note that you must set your environment variables to the provider keys when you run this. 
For example, when running this I’d start the file by calling set_environment() from config:
from config import set_environment
set_environment()
We get this output:
Why did the light bulb go to therapy?
Because it was feeling a little dim!
For the Gemini model, we can run:
response = gemini_pro.invoke("Tell me a joke about light bulbs!")
For me, Gemini comes up with this joke:
Why did the light bulb get a speeding ticket?
Because it was caught going over the watt limit!
Notice how we use the same invoke() method regardless of the provider. This consistency makes 
it easy to experiment with different models or switch providers in production.
Development testing
During development, you might want to test your application without making actual API calls. 
LangChain provides FakeListLLM for this purpose:
from langchain_community.llms import FakeListLLM
# Create a fake LLM that always returns the same response
fake_llm = FakeListLLM(responses=["Hello"])
result = fake_llm.invoke("Any input will return Hello")
print(result)  # Output: Hello
