Building Intelligent RAG Systems
140
Modern retrieval systems often combine multiple approaches for better results:
1.	
Hybrid search: Combines semantic and lexical search to leverage:
•	
Vector similarity for semantic understanding
•	
Keyword matching for precise terminology
•	
Weighted combinations for optimal results
2.	
Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR): Optimizes for both relevance and diversity by:
•	
Selecting documents similar to the query
•	
Ensuring retrieved documents are distinct from each other
•	
Balancing exploration and exploitation
3.	
Custom retrieval logic: LangChain allows the creation of specialized retrievers by imple­
menting the BaseRetriever class.
Advanced RAG techniques
When building production RAG systems, a simple vector similarity search often isn’t enough. Mod­
ern applications need more sophisticated approaches to find and validate relevant information. 
Let’s explore how to enhance a basic RAG system with advanced techniques that dramatically 
improve result quality.
A standard vector search has several limitations:
•	
It might miss contextually relevant documents that use different terminology
•	
It can’t distinguish between authoritative and less reliable sources
•	
It might return redundant or contradictory information
•	
It has no way to verify if generated responses accurately reflect the source material
Modern retrieval systems often employ multiple complementary techniques to improve result 
quality. Two particularly powerful approaches are hybrid retrieval and re-ranking.
Hybrid retrieval: Combining semantic and keyword search
Hybrid retrieval combines two retrieval methods in parallel and the results are fused to leverage 
the strengths of both approaches:
•	
Dense retrieval: Uses vector embeddings for semantic understanding
•	
Sparse retrieval: Employs lexical methods like BM25 for keyword precision
