Production-Ready LLM Deployment and Observability
394
Different types of metrics call for different monitoring cadences. Real-time monitoring is essential 
for latency, error rates, and other critical quality issues. Daily analysis is better suited for review­
ing usage patterns, cost metrics, and general quality scores. More in-depth evaluations—such 
as model drift, benchmark comparisons, and bias analysis—are typically reviewed on a weekly 
or monthly basis.
To avoid alert fatigue while still catching important issues, alerting strategies should be thought­
ful and layered. Use staged alerting to distinguish between informational warnings and critical 
system failures. Instead of relying on static thresholds, baseline-based alerts adapt to historical 
trends, making them more resilient to normal fluctuations. Composite alerts can also improve 
signal quality by triggering only when multiple conditions are met, reducing noise and improving 
response focus.
With these measurements in place, it’s essential to establish processes for the ongoing improve­
ment and optimization of LLM apps. Continuous improvement involves integrating human feed­
back to refine models, tracking performance across versions using version control, and automating 
testing and deployment for efficient updates.
Continuous improvement for LLM applications
Observability is not just about monitoring—it should actively drive continuous improvement. 
By leveraging observability data, teams can perform root cause analysis to identify the sources 
of issues and use A/B testing to compare different prompts, models, or parameters based on key 
metrics. Feedback integration plays a crucial role, incorporating user input to refine models and 
prompts, while maintaining thorough documentation ensures a clear record of changes and their 
impact on performance for institutional knowledge.
We recommend employing key methods for enabling continuous improvement. These include 
establishing feedback loops that incorporate human feedback, such as user ratings or expert an­
notations, to fine-tune model behavior over time. Model comparison is another critical practice, 
allowing teams to track and evaluate performance across different versions through version con­
trol. Finally, integrating observability with CI/CD pipelines automates testing and deployment, 
ensuring that updates are efficiently validated and rapidly deployed to production.
By implementing continuous improvement processes, you can ensure that your LLM agents remain 
aligned with evolving performance objectives and safety standards. This approach complements 
the deployment and observability practices discussed in this chapter, creating a comprehensive 
framework for maintaining and enhancing LLM applications throughout their lifecycle.
