Recursive character chunking
This method respects natural text boundaries by recursively applying different separators:
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""],
    chunk_size=150,
    chunk_overlap=20
)
document = """
document = """# Introduction to RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval systems with 
generative AI models.
It helps address hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved 
information.
## Key Components
RAG consists of several components:
1. Document processing
2. Vector embedding
3. Retrieval
4. Augmentation
5. Generation
### Document Processing
This step involves loading and chunking documents appropriately.

chunks = text_splitter.split_text(document)
