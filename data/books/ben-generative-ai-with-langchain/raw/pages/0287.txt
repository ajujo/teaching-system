We can control the maximum number of super-steps, the maximum number of paths in the tree 
to be explored (in particular, the maximum number of candidates for the final solution to be 
generated), and the number of candidates per step. Potentially, we could extend our config and 
control the maximum depth of the tree. Let’s run our graph:
task = "Write a strategic one-pager of building an AI startup"
result = await graph.ainvoke({"task": task}, config={"recursion_limit": 
10000, "configurable": {"max_paths": 10}})
print(len(result["candidates"]))
print(result["best_candidate"])
We can also visualize the explored tree:
