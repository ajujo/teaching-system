LLMs in software development
The relationship between natural language and programming is undergoing a significant trans­
formation. Traditional programming languages remain essential in software development—C++ 
and Rust for performance-critical applications, Java and C# for enterprise systems, and Python 
for rapid development, data analysis, and ML workflows. However, natural language, particularly 
English, now serves as a powerful interface to streamline software development and data science 
tasks, complementing rather than replacing these specialized programming tools.
Advanced AI assistants let you build software by simply staying “in the vibe” of what you want, 
without ever writing or even picturing a line of code. This style of development, known as vibe 
coding, was popularized by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025. Instead of framing tasks in program­
ming terms or wrestling with syntax, you describe desired behaviors, user flows or outcomes in 
plain conversation. The model then orchestrates data structures, logic and integration behind 
the scenes. With vibe coding you don’t debug—you re-vibe. This means, you iterate by restating 
or refining requirements in natural language, and let the assistant reshape the system. The result 
is a pure, intuitive design-first workflow that completely abstracts away all coding details.
Tools such as Cursor, Windsurf (formerly Codeium), OpenHands, and Amazon Q Developer have 
emerged to support this development approach, each offering different capabilities for AI-assisted 
coding. In practice, these interfaces are democratizing software creation while freeing experienced 
engineers from repetitive tasks. However, balancing speed with code quality and security remains 
critical, especially for production systems.
The software development landscape has long sought to make programming more accessible 
through various abstraction layers. Early efforts included fourth-generation languages that aimed 
to simplify syntax, allowing developers to express logic with fewer lines of code. This evolution 
continued with modern low-code platforms, which introduced visual programming with pre-
built components to democratize application development beyond traditional coding experts. 
The latest and perhaps most transformative evolution features natural language programming 
through LLMs, which interpret human intentions expressed in plain language and translate 
them into functional code.
