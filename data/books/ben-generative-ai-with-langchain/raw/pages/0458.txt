Appendix A
This appendix serves as a practical reference guide to the major LLM providers that integrate 
with LangChain. As you develop applications with the techniques covered throughout this book, 
you’ll need to connect to various model providers, each with its own authentication mechanisms, 
capabilities, and integration patterns.
We’ll first cover the detailed setup instructions for the major LLM providers, including OpenAI, 
Hugging Face, Google, and others. For each provider, we walk through the process of creating ac­
counts, generating API keys, and configuring your development environment to use these services 
with LangChain. We then conclude with a practical implementation example that demonstrates 
how to process content exceeding an LLM’s context window—specifically, summarizing long 
videos using map-reduce techniques with LangChain. This pattern can be adapted for various 
scenarios where you need to process large volumes of text, audio transcripts, or other content 
that won’t fit into a single LLM context.
OpenAI
OpenAI remains one of the most popular LLM providers, offering models with various levels of 
power suitable for different tasks, including GPT-4 and GPT-o1. LangChain provides seamless 
integration with OpenAI’s APIs, supporting both their traditional completion models and chat 
models. Each of these models has its own price, typically per token.
To work with OpenAI models, we need to obtain an OpenAI API key first. To create an API key, 
follow these steps:
1.	
You need to create a login at https://platform.openai.com/.
2.	
Set up your billing information.
3.	
You can see the API keys under Personal | View API Keys.
4.	
Click on Create new secret key and give it a name.
