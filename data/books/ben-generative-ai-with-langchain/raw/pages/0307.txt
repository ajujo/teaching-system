Performance assessment requires looking beyond mere functionality. Benchmark the 
execution time of LLM-generated code against existing solutions to identify potential 
inefficiencies. Testing with progressively larger datasets often reveals scaling limitations 
that weren’t apparent with sample data. Profile memory usage systematically, as LLMs 
may not optimize for resource constraints unless explicitly instructed. This performance 
data provides crucial information for deployment decisions and identifies opportunities 
for optimization.
•	
Security screening should never be an afterthought when working with generated code. 
Scan for unsafe functions, potential injection vulnerabilities, and insecure API calls—is­
sues that LLMs may introduce despite their training in secure coding practices. Verify the 
proper handling of authentication credentials and sensitive data, especially when the 
model has been instructed to include API access. Check carefully for hardcoded secrets 
or unintentional data exposures that could create security vulnerabilities in production.
•	
Robustness testing extends validation beyond the happy path scenarios. Test with edge 
cases and unexpected inputs that reveal how the code handles extreme conditions. Verify 
that error handling mechanisms are comprehensive and provide meaningful feedback 
rather than cryptic failures. Evaluate the code’s resilience to malformed or missing data, 
as production environments rarely provide the pristine data conditions assumed in de­
velopment.
•	
Business logic verification focuses on domain-specific requirements that LLMs may 
not fully understand. Confirm that industry-specific constraints and business rules are 
correctly implemented, especially regulatory requirements that vary by sector. Verify 
calculations and transformations against manual calculations for critical processes, as 
subtle mathematical differences can significantly impact business outcomes. Ensure all 
regulatory or policy requirements relevant to your industry are properly addressed—a 
crucial step when LLMs may lack domain-specific compliance knowledge.
•	
Documentation and explainability complete the validation process by ensuring sustain­
able use of the generated code. Either require the LLM to provide or separately generate 
inline comments that explain complex sections and algorithmic choices. Document any 
assumptions made by the model that might impact future maintenance or enhancement. 
Create validation reports that link code functionality directly to business requirements, 
providing traceability that supports both technical and business stakeholders.
