The Future of Generative Models: Beyond Scaling
414
Scaling down (efficiency innovations)
The efficiency paradigm focuses on achieving more with less through several key techniques:
•	
Quantization converts models to lower precision by reducing bit sizes of weights and 
activations. This technique can compress large model performance into smaller form 
factors, dramatically reducing computational and storage requirements.
•	
Model distillation transfers knowledge from large “teacher” models to smaller, more 
efficient “student” models, enabling deployment on more limited hardware.
•	
Memory-augmented architectures represent a breakthrough approach. Meta FAIR’s 
December 2024 research on memory layers demonstrated how to improve model ca­
pabilities without proportional increases in computational requirements. By replacing 
some feed-forward networks with trainable key-value memory layers scaled to 128 bil­
lion parameters, researchers achieved over 100% improvement in factual accuracy while 
also enhancing performance on coding and general knowledge tasks. Remarkably, these 
memory-augmented models matched the performance of dense models trained with 4x 
more compute, directly challenging the assumption that more computation is the only 
path to better performance. This approach specifically targets factual reliability—address­
ing the hallucination problem that has persisted despite increasing scale in traditional 
architectures.
•	
Specialized models offer another alternative to general-purpose systems. Rather than 
pursuing general intelligence through scale, focused models tailored to specific domains 
often deliver better performance at lower costs. Microsoft’s Phi series, now advanced 
to phi-3 (April 2024), demonstrates how careful data curation can dramatically alter 
scaling laws. While models like GPT-4 were trained on vast, heterogeneous datasets, the 
Phi series achieved remarkable performance with much smaller models by focusing on 
high-quality textbook-like data.
Scaling out (distributed approaches)
This distributed paradigm explores how to leverage networks of models and computational 
resources.
Test-time compute shifts focus from training larger models to allocating more computation 
during inference time. This allows models to reason through problems more thoroughly. Google 
DeepMind’s Mind Evolution approach achieves over 98% success rates on complex planning 
tasks without requiring larger models, demonstrating the power of evolutionary search strat­
egies during inference. This approach consumes three million tokens due to very long prompts, 
compared to 9,000 tokens for normal Gemini operations, but achieves dramatically better results.
