To test the model’s code generation capabilities, we’ll use LangChain to interface with Gemini 
Pro and provide the FizzBuzz problem statement:
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
question = """
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
"""
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-1.5-pro")
print(llm.invoke(question).content)
Gemini Pro immediately returns a clean, correct Python solution that properly handles all the 
FizzBuzz requirements:
```python
    answer = []
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            answer.append("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            answer.append("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            answer.append("Buzz")
        else:
            answer.append(str(i))
    
    return answer
```
The model produced an efficient, well-structured solution that correctly implements the logic 
for the FizzBuzz problem without any errors or unnecessary complexity. Would you hire Gemini 
Pro for your team?
