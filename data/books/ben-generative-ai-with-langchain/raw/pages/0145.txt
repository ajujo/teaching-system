Building Intelligent RAG Systems
118
For many applications starting with RAG, lightweight options like ChromaDB provide an excellent 
balance of simplicity and functionality, while enterprise deployments might benefit from the ad­
vanced features of Pinecone or AnalyticDB-V. Modern vector stores support several search patterns:
•	
Exact search: Returns precise nearest neighbors but becomes computationally prohibitive 
with large vector collections
•	
Approximate search: Trades accuracy for speed using techniques like LSH, HNSW, or 
quantization; measured by recall (the percentage of true nearest neighbors retrieved)
•	
Hybrid search: Combines vector similarity with text-based search (like keyword matching 
or BM25) in a single query
•	
Filtered vector search: Applies traditional database filters (for example, metadata con­
straints) alongside vector similarity search
Vector stores also handle different types of embeddings:
•	
Dense vector search: Uses continuous embeddings where most dimensions have non-zero 
values, typically from neural models (like BERT, OpenAI embeddings)
•	
Sparse vector search: Uses high-dimensional vectors where most values are zero, resem­
bling traditional TF-IDF or BM25 representations
•	
Sparse-dense hybrid: Combines both approaches to leverage semantic similarity (dense) 
and keyword precision (sparse)
They also often give a choice of multiple similarity measures, for example:
•	
Inner product: Useful for comparing semantic directions
•	
Cosine similarity: Normalizes for vector magnitude
•	
Euclidean distance: Measures the L2 distance in vector space (note: with normalized 
embeddings, this becomes functionally equivalent to the dot product)
•	
Hamming distance: For binary vector representations
When implementing vector storage for RAG applications, one of the first architectural decisions 
is whether to use local storage or a cloud-based solution. Let’s explore the tradeoffs and consid­
erations for each approach.
•	
Choose local storage when you need maximum control, have strict privacy requirements, 
or operate at a smaller scale with predictable workloads.
•	
Choose cloud storage when you need elastic scaling, prefer managed services, or operate 
distributed applications with variable workloads.
