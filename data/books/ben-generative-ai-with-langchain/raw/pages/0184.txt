While CRAG enhances RAG by adding evaluation and correction mechanisms to the retrieval 
pipeline, Agentic RAG represents a more fundamental paradigm shift by introducing autonomous 
AI agents to orchestrate the entire RAG process.
Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG employs AI agents—autonomous systems capable of planning, reasoning, and deci­
sion-making—to dynamically manage information retrieval and generation. Unlike traditional 
RAG or even CRAG, which follow relatively structured workflows, agentic RAG uses agents to:
•	
Analyze queries and decompose complex questions into manageable sub-questions
•	
Plan information-gathering strategies based on the specific task requirements
•	
Select appropriate tools (retrievers, web search, calculators, APIs, etc.)
•	
Execute multi-step processes, potentially involving multiple rounds of retrieval and rea­
soning
•	
Reflect on intermediate results and adapt strategies accordingly
The key distinction between CRAG and agentic RAG lies in their focus: CRAG primarily enhances 
data quality through evaluation and correction, while agentic RAG focuses on process intelligence 
through autonomous planning and orchestration.
Agentic RAG is particularly valuable for complex use cases that require:
•	
Multi-step reasoning across multiple information sources
•	
Dynamic tool selection based on query analysis
•	
Persistent task execution with intermediate reflection
•	
Integration with various external systems and APIs
However, agentic RAG introduces significant complexity in implementation, potentially higher 
latency due to multiple reasoning steps, and increased computational costs from multiple LLM 
calls for planning and reflection.
In Chapter 5, we’ll explore the implementation of agent-based systems in depth, including pat­
terns that can be applied to create agentic RAG systems. The core techniques—tool integration, 
planning, reflection, and orchestration—are fundamental to both general agent systems and 
agentic RAG specifically.
By understanding both CRAG and agentic RAG approaches, you’ll be equipped to select the most 
appropriate RAG architecture based on your specific requirements, balancing accuracy, flexibility, 
complexity, and performance.
