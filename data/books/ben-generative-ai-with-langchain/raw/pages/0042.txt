b.	 Conversation history: Maintaining information across extended conversations 
requires careful memory management
c.	
Cost management: Most providers charge based on token count, making efficient 
token use a business imperative
These constraints directly impact application architecture, making techniques like RAG 
(which we’ll explore in Chapter 4) essential for production systems.
2.	
Limited tool orchestration: While many modern LLMs offer native tool-calling capabili­
ties, they lack the infrastructure to discover appropriate tools, execute complex workflows, 
and manage tool interactions across multiple turns. Without this orchestration layer, 
developers must build custom solutions for each integration.
3.	
Task coordination challenges: Managing multi-step workflows with LLMs requires 
structured control mechanisms. Without them, complex processes involving sequential 
reasoning or decision-making become difficult to implement reliably.
Tools in this context refer to functional capabilities that extend an LLM’s reach: web browsers for 
searching the internet, calculators for precise mathematics, coding environments for executing 
programs, or APIs for accessing external services and databases. Without these tools, LLMs remain 
confined to operating within their training knowledge, unable to perform real-world actions or 
access current information.
These fundamental limitations create three key challenges for developers working with raw LLM 
APIs, as demonstrated in the following table.

LangChain addresses these challenges by providing a structured framework with tested solutions, 
simplifying AI application development and enabling more sophisticated use cases.
