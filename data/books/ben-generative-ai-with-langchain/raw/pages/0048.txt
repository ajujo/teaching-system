External partner packages: Some partners maintain their integration packages inde­
pendently. For example, several packages from the Google organization (github.com/
orgs/googleapis/repositories?q=langchain), such as the langchain-google-cloud-
sql-mssql package, are developed and maintained outside the LangChain ecosystem.

LangGraph, LangSmith, and companion tools
LangChain’s core functionality is extended by the following companion projects:
•	
LangGraph: An orchestration framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications 
with LLMs. While it integrates smoothly with LangChain, it can also be used independent­
ly. LangGraph facilitates complex applications with cyclic data flows and supports stream­
ing and human-in-the-loop interactions. We’ll talk about LangGraph in more detail in 
Chapter 3.
•	
LangSmith: A platform that complements LangChain by providing robust debugging, 
testing, and monitoring capabilities. Developers can inspect, monitor, and evaluate their 
applications, ensuring continuous optimization and confident deployment.
For full details on the dozens of available modules and packages, refer to the compre­
hensive LangChain API reference: https://api.python.langchain.com/. There 
are also hundreds of code examples demonstrating real-world use cases: https://
python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/use_cases/.
