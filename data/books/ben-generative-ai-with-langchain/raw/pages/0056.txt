You can also expose these variables in your system environment from your terminal. In Linux and 
macOS, you can set a system environment variable from the terminal using the export command:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your token>
To permanently set the environment variable in Linux or macOS, you would need to add the 
preceding line to the ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile files, and then reload the shell using the 
command source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.bash_profile.
For Windows users, you can set the environment variable by searching for “Environment Vari­
ables” in the system settings, editing either “User variables” or “System variables,” and adding 
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here.
Our choice is to create a config.py file where all API keys are stored. We then import a function 
from this module that loads these keys into the environment variables. This approach centralizes 
credential management and makes it easier to update keys when needed:
import os
OPENAI_API_KEY =  "... "
# I'm omitting all other keys
def set_environment():
    variable_dict = globals().items()
    for key, value in variable_dict:
        if "API" in key or "ID" in key:
             os.environ[key] = value
If you search for this file in the GitHub repository, you’ll notice it’s missing. This is intentional – 
I’ve excluded it from Git tracking using the .gitignore file. The .gitignore file tells Git which 
files to ignore when committing changes, which is essential for:
1.	
Preventing sensitive credentials from being publicly exposed
2.	 Avoiding accidental commits of personal API keys
3.	
Protecting yourself from unauthorized usage charges
To implement this yourself, simply add config.py to your .gitignore file:
# In .gitignore
config.py
.env
**/api_keys.txt
# Other sensitive files
