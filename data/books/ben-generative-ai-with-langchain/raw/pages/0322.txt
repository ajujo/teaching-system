1. Task planner and executor for software development: This indicates that 
the code includes functionality for planning and executing tasks related 
to software development.
2. debug your code: This suggests that there is a recommendation to debug 
the code if an error occurs during software development.
These examples provide insights into the software development process de­
scribed in the context.
The response is somewhat limited, likely because our small chunk size (50 characters) may have 
fragmented code examples. While the system correctly identifies mentions of task planning and 
debugging, it doesn’t provide detailed code examples or context. In a production environment, 
you might want to increase the chunk size or implement hierarchical chunking to preserve more 
context. Additionally, using a code-specific embedding model could further improve the relevance 
of retrieved results.
In the next section, we’ll explore how generative AI agents can automate and enhance data science 
workflows. LangChain agents can write and execute code, analyze datasets, and even build and 
train ML models with minimal human guidance. We’ll demonstrate two powerful applications: 
training a neural network model and analyzing a structured dataset.
Applying LLM agents for data science
The integration of LLMs into data science workflows represents a significant, though nuanced, 
evolution in how analytical tasks are approached. While traditional data science methods remain 
essential for complex numerical analysis, LLMs offer complementary capabilities that primarily 
enhance accessibility and assist with specific aspects of the workflow.
Independent research reveals a more measured reality than some vendor claims suggest. Accord­
ing to multiple studies, LLMs demonstrate variable effectiveness across different data science 
tasks, with performance often declining as complexity increases. A study published in PLOS 
One found that “the executability of generated code decreased significantly as the complexity of 
the data analysis task increased,” highlighting the limitations of current models when handling 
sophisticated analytical challenges.
