Building Intelligent Agents

In Chapter 6, we’ll see some additional adjustments you can use with the create_react_agent 
function.
Defining tools
So far, we have defined tools as OpenAPI schemas. But to run the workflow end to end, LangGraph 
should be able to call tools itself during the execution. Hence, in this section, let’s discuss how 
we define tools as Python functions or callables. 
A LangChain tool has three essential components: 
•	
Name: A unique identifier for the tool 
•	
Description: Text that helps the LLM understand when and how to use the tool 
•	
Payload schema: A structured definition of the inputs the tool accepts
It allows an LLM to decide when and how to call a tool. Another important distinction of a Lang­
Chain tool is that it can be executed by an orchestrator, such as LangGraph. The base interface 
for a tool is BaseTool, which inherits from a RunnableSerializable itself. That means it can be 
invoked or batched as any Runnable, or serialized or deserialized as any Serializable.
Built-in LangChain tools
LangChain has many tools already available across various categories. Since tools are often pro­
vided by third-party vendors, some tools require paid API keys, some of them are completely 
free, and some of them have a free tier. Some tools are grouped together in toolkits—collections 
of tools that are supposed to be used together when working on a specific task.  Let’s see some 
examples of using tools.
Tools give an LLM access to search engines, such as Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google, and Tavily. Let’s 
take a look at DuckDuckGoSearchRun as this search engine doesn’t require additional registration 
and an API key. 
Please see Chapter 2 for setup instructions. If you have any questions or encounter issues while 
running the code, please create an issue on GitHub or join the discussion on Discord at https://
packt.link/lang.
As with any tool, this tool has a name, description, and schema for input arguments:
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
print(f"Tool's name = {search.name}")
