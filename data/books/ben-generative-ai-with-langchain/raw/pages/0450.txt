•	
Legal profession: Routine legal work like document review and draft preparation will be 
largely automated, fundamentally changing job roles for junior lawyers and paralegals. 
Law firms that have already begun this transition report maintaining headcount while 
significantly increasing caseload capacity.
•	
Education: Teachers will utilize AI for course preparation, administrative tasks, and per­
sonalized student support. Students are already using generative AI to learn new concepts 
through personalized teaching interactions, asking follow-up questions to clarify un­
derstanding at their own pace. The teacher’s role will evolve toward mentorship, critical 
thinking development, and creative learning design rather than pure information delivery, 
focusing on aspects where human guidance adds the most value.
•	
Healthcare: While clinical decision-making will remain primarily human, diagnostic 
support, documentation, and routine monitoring will be increasingly automated, allowing 
healthcare providers to focus on complex cases and patient relationships.
Long-term shifts (2045 and beyond)
As technology approaches more empathy-requiring roles, we can expect the following to be in 
demand:
•	
Specialized expertise: Demand will grow significantly for experts in AI ethics, regulations, 
security oversight, and human-AI collaboration design. These roles will be essential for 
ensuring responsible outcomes as systems become more autonomous.
•	
Creative fields: Musicians and artists will develop new forms of human-AI collaboration, 
potentially boosting creative expression and accessibility while raising new questions 
about attribution and originality.
•	
Leadership and strategy: Roles requiring complex judgment, ethical reasoning, and stake­
holder management will be among the last to see significant automation, potentially 
increasing their relative value in the economy.
Economic distribution and equity considerations
Without deliberate policy interventions, the economic benefits of AI may accrue disproportion­
ately to those with the capital, skills, and infrastructure to leverage these technologies, potentially 
widening existing inequalities. This concern is particularly relevant for:
•	
Geographic disparities: Regions with strong technological infrastructure and education 
systems may pull further ahead of less-developed areas.
