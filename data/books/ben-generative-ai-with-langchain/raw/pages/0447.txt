The Future of Generative Models: Beyond Scaling
420
The evolution of AI adoption can be better understood within the context of previous technological 
revolutions, which typically follow an S-curve pattern with three distinct phases, as described 
in Everett Rogers’ seminal work Diffusion of Innovations. While typical technological revolutions 
have historically followed these phases over many decades, Leopold Aschenbrenner’s Situational 
Awareness: The Decade Ahead (2024) argues that AI implementation may follow a compressed 
timeline due to its unique ability to improve itself and accelerate its own development. Aschen­
brenner’s analysis suggests that the traditional S-curve might be dramatically steepened for AI 
technologies, potentially compressing adoption cycles that previously took decades into years:
1.	
Learning phase (5-30 years): Initial experimentation and infrastructure development
2.	
Doing phase (10-20 years): Rapid scaling once enabling infrastructure matures
3.	
Optimization phase (ongoing): Incremental improvements after saturation
Recent analyses indicate that AI implementation will likely follow a more complex, phased tra­
jectory:
•	
2030-2040: Manufacturing, logistics, and repetitive office tasks could reach 70-90% 
automation
•	
2040-2050: Service sectors like healthcare and education might reach 40-60% automa­
tion as humanoid robots and AGI capabilities mature
•	
Post-2050: Societal and ethical considerations may delay full automation of roles re­
quiring empathy
Based on analyses from the World Economic Forum’s “Future of Jobs Report 2023” and McKinsey 
Global Institute’s research on automation potential across sectors, we can map the relative au­
tomation potential across key industries:
Specific automation levels and projections reveal varying rates of adoption:
 Sector
Automation Potential
Key Drivers
Manufacturing
High—especially in repetitive 
tasks and structured 
environments
Collaborative robots, machine 
vision, AI quality control
Logistics/
Warehousing
High—particularly in sorting, 
picking, and inventory
Autonomous mobile robots 
(AMRs), automated sorting 
systems
