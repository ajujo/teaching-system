        backend:
          service:
            name: langchain-app-service
            port:
              number: 80
The Ingress resource exposes your application to external traffic, mapping a domain name to 
your service. This provides a way for users to access your LangChain application from outside 
the Kubernetes cluster. The configuration assumes you have an Ingress controller (like Nginx) 
installed in your cluster.
With all the configuration files ready, you can now deploy your application using the following 
commands:
# Apply each file in appropriate order
kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
kubectl get ingress
These commands apply your configurations to the Kubernetes cluster and verify that everything 
is running correctly. You’ll see the status of your Pods, Services, and Ingress resources, allowing 
you to confirm that your deployment was successful. By following this deployment approach, 
you gain several benefits that are essential for production-ready LLM applications. Security is 
enhanced by storing API keys as Kubernetes Secrets rather than hardcoding them directly in your 
application code. The approach also ensures reliability through multiple replicas and health 
checks that maintain continuous availability even if individual instances fail. Your deployment 
benefits from precise resource control with specific memory and CPU limits that prevent unex­
pected cost overruns while maintaining performance. As your usage grows, the configuration 
offers straightforward scalability by simply adjusting the replica count to handle increased load. 
Finally, the implementation provides accessibility through properly configured Ingress rules, 
allowing external users and systems to securely connect to your LLM services.
