This configuration tells the deployment platform:
•
Where to find your application code
•
Which graph(s) to expose as endpoints
•
How to load environment variables
Ensure the graph is properly exported in your code:
# my_agent/agent.py
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START
# Define the graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
# ... add nodes and edges ...
# Compile and export - this variable is referenced in langgraph.json
graph = workflow.compile()
Specify dependencies in requirements.txt:
langgraph>=0.2.56,<0.4.0
langgraph-sdk>=0.1.53
langchain-core>=0.2.38,<0.4.0
# Add other dependencies your application needs
Set up environment variables in .env:
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# Add other API keys and configuration
The LangGraph cloud provides a fast path to production with a fully managed service.
While manual deployment through the UI is possible, the recommended approach for production
applications is to implement automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/
CD) pipelines.
