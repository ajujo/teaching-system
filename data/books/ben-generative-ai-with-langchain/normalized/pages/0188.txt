Developing a corporate documentation chatbot
In this section, we will build a corporate documentation chatbot that leverages LangChain for
LLM interactions and LangGraph for state management and workflow orchestration. LangGraph
complements the implementation in several critical ways:
•
Explicit state management: Unlike basic RAG pipelines that operate as linear sequences,
LangGraph maintains a formal state object containing all relevant information (queries,
retrieved documents, intermediate results, etc.).
•
Conditional processing: LangGraph enables conditional branching based on the quality
of retrieved documents or other evaluation criteria-essential for ensuring reliable output.
•
Multi-step reasoning: For complex documentation tasks, LangGraph allows breaking
the process into discrete steps (retrieval, generation, validation, refinement) while main­
taining context throughout.
•
Human-in-the-loop integration: When document quality or compliance cannot be au­
tomatically verified, LangGraph facilitates seamless integration of human feedback.
With the Corporate Documentation Manager tool we built, you can generate, validate, and
refine project documentation while incorporating human feedback to ensure compliance with
corporate standards. In many organizations, maintaining up-to-date project documentation is
critical. Our pipeline leverages LLMs to:
•
Generate documentation: Produce detailed project documentation from a user's prompt
•
Conduct compliance checks: Analyze the generated document for adherence to corporate
standards and best practices
•
Handle human feedback: Solicit expert feedback if compliance issues are detected
•
Finalize documentation: Revise the document based on feedback to ensure it is both
accurate and compliant
The idea is that this process not only streamlines documentation creation but also introduces
a safety net by involving human-in-the-loop validation. The code is split into several modules,
each handling a specific part of the pipeline, and a Streamlit app ties everything together for a
web-based interface.
The code will demonstrate the following key features:
•
Modular pipeline design: Defines a clear state and uses nodes for documentation gen­
eration, compliance analysis, human feedback, and finalization
