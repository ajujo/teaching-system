To unlock the next phase of AI capabilities, we need to move beyond passive text generation and
toward agentic AI-systems that can plan, reason, and take action to accomplish tasks with
minimal human intervention. Before exploring the potential of agentic AI, it's important to first
understand the core limitations of LLMs that necessitate this evolution.
Limitations of traditional LLMs
Despite their advanced language capabilities, LLMs have inherent constraints that limit their
effectiveness in real-world applications:
1.
Lack of true understanding: LLMs generate human-like text by predicting the next most
likely word based on statistical patterns in training data. However, they do not understand
meaning in the way humans do. This leads to hallucinations-confidently stating false
information as fact-and generating plausible but incorrect, misleading, or nonsensical
outputs. As Bender et al. (2021) describe, LLMs function as "stochastic parrots"-repeating
patterns without genuine comprehension.
2.
Struggles with complex reasoning and problem-solving: While LLMs excel at retrieving
and reformatting knowledge, they struggle with multi-step reasoning, logical puzzles, and
mathematical problem-solving. They often fail to break down problems into sub-tasks or
synthesize information across different contexts. Without explicit prompting techniques
like chain-of-thought reasoning, their ability to deduce or infer remains unreliable.
3.
Outdated knowledge and limited external access: LLMs are trained on static datasets
and do not have real-time access to current events, dynamic databases, or live information
sources. This makes them unsuitable for tasks requiring up-to-date knowledge, such as
financial analysis, breaking news summaries, or scientific research requiring the latest
findings.
4.
No native tool use or action-taking abilities: LLMs operate in isolation-they cannot
interact with APIs, retrieve live data, execute code, or modify external systems. This lack
of tool integration makes them less effective in scenarios that require real-world actions,
such as conducting web searches, automating workflows, or controlling software systems.
5.
Bias, ethical concerns, and reliability issues: Because LLMs learn from large datasets
that may contain biases, they can unintentionally reinforce ideological, social, or cultural
biases. Importantly, even with open-source models, accessing and auditing the complete
training data to identify and mitigate these biases remains challenging for most prac­
titioners. Additionally, they can generate misleading or harmful information without
understanding the ethical implications of their outputs.
