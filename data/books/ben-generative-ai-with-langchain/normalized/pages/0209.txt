What are agents?
Let's begin with tools. Rather than diving straight into defining what an agent is, it's more helpful
to first explore how enhancing LLMs with tools actually works in practice. By walking through
this step by step, you'll see how these integrations unlock new capabilities. So, what exactly are
tools, and how do they extend what LLMs can do?
What is a tool?
LLMs are trained on vast general corpus data (like web data and books), which gives them broad
knowledge but limits their effectiveness in tasks that require domain-specific or up-to-date knowl­
edge. However, because LLMs are good at reasoning, they can interact with the external environ­
ment through tools-APIs or interfaces that allow the model to interact with the external world.
These tools enable LLMs to perform specific tasks and receive feedback from the external world.
When using tools, LLMs perform three specific generation tasks:
1.
Choose a tool to use by generating special tokens and the name of the tool.
2.
Generate a payload to be sent to the tool.
3.
Generate a response to a user based on the initial question and a history of interactions
with tools (for this specific run).
Now it's time to figure out how LLMs invoke tools and how we can make LLMs tool-aware. Con­
sider a somewhat artificial but illustrative question: What is the square root of the current US pres­
ident's age multiplied by 132? This question presents two specific challenges:
•
It references current information (as of March 2025) that likely falls outside the model's
training data.
