Figure 4.3: The relationship between query, retriever, and documents
LangChain offers a rich ecosystem of retrievers, each designed to solve specific information re­
trieval challenges.
LangChain retrievers
The retrievers can be broadly categorized into a few key groups that serve different use cases and
implementation needs:
•
Core infrastructure retrievers include both self-hosted options like ElasticsearchRetriever
and cloud-based solutions from major providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
•
External knowledge retrievers tap into external and established knowledge bases. Arx­
ivRetriever, WikipediaRetriever, and TavilySearchAPI stand out here, offering direct access
to academic papers, encyclopedia entries, and web content respectively.
•
Algorithmic retrievers include several classic information retrieval methods. The BM25
and TF-IDF retrievers excel at lexical search, while kNN retrievers handle semantic sim­
ilarity searches. Each of these algorithms brings its own strengths - BM25 for keyword
precision, TF-IDF for document classification, and kNN for similarity matching.
•
Advanced/Specialized retrievers often address specific performance requirements or
resource constraints that may arise in production environments. LangChain offers spe­
cialized retrievers with unique capabilities. NeuralDB provides CPU-optimized retrieval,
while LLMLingua focuses on document compression.
•
Integration retrievers connect with popular platforms and services. These retrievers,
like those for Google Drive or Outline, make it easier to incorporate existing document
repositories into your RAG application.
