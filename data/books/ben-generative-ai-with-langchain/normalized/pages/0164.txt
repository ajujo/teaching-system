Table 4.4: Comparison of chunking strategies
We recommend starting with Level 2 (Recursive Character Chunking) as your baseline, then
experiment with more advanced strategies if retrieval quality needs improvement.
For most RAG applications, the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with appropriate chunk size
and overlap settings provides an excellent balance of simplicity, performance, and retrieval qual­
ity. As your system matures, you can evaluate whether more sophisticated chunking strategies
deliver meaningful improvements.
However, it is often critical to performance to experiment with different chunk sizes specific to your
use case and document types. Please refer to Chapter 8 for testing and benchmarking strategies.
The next section covers semantic search, hybrid methods, and advanced ranking techniques.
Retrieval
Retrieval integrates a vector store with other LangChain components for simplified querying
and compatibility. Retrieval systems form a crucial bridge between unstructured queries and
relevant documents.
In LangChain, a retriever is fundamentally an interface that accepts natural language queries and
returns relevant documents. Let's explore how this works in detail.
At its heart, a retriever in LangChain follows a simple yet powerful pattern:
•
Input: Takes a query as a string
•
Processing: Applies retrieval logic specific to the implementation
•
Output: Returns a list of document objects, each containing:
•
page_content: The actual document content
•
metadata: Associated information like document ID or source
