Document processing
LangChain provides a comprehensive system for loading documents from various sources through
document loaders. A document loader is a component in LangChain that transforms various
data sources into a standardized document format that can be used throughout the LangChain
ecosystem. Each document contains the actual content and associated metadata.
Document loaders serve as the foundation for RAG systems by:
•
Converting diverse data sources into a uniform format
•
Extracting text and metadata from files
•
Preparing documents for further processing (like chunking or embedding)
LangChain supports loading documents from a wide range of document types and sources through
specialized loaders, for example:
•
PDFs: Using PyPDFLoader
•
HTML: WebBaseLoader for extracting web page text
•
Plain text: TextLoader for raw text inputs
•
WebBaseLoader for web page content extraction
•
ArxivLoader for scientific papers
•
WikipediaLoader for encyclopedia entries
•
YoutubeLoader for video transcripts
•
ImageCaptionLoader for image content
You may have noticed some non-text content types in the preceding list. Advanced RAG systems
can handle non-text data; for example, image embeddings or audio transcripts.
