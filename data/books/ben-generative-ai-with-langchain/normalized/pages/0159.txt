Document loaders come with a standard .load() method interface that returns documents in
LangChain's document format. The initialization is source-specific. After loading, documents
often need processing before storage and retrieval, and selecting the right chunking strategy
determines the relevance and diversity of AI-generated responses.
Chunking strategies
Chunking-how you divide documents into smaller pieces-can dramatically impact your RAG
system's performance. Poor chunking can break apart related concepts, lose critical context, and
ultimately lead to irrelevant retrieval results. The way you chunk documents affects:
•
Retrieval accuracy: Well-formed chunks maintain semantic coherence, making them
easier to match with relevant queries
•
Context preservation: Poor chunking can split related information, causing knowledge
gaps
•
Response quality: When the LLM receives fragmented or irrelevant chunks, it generates
less accurate responses
Let's explore a hierarchy of chunking approaches, from simple to sophisticated, to help you im­
plement the most effective strategy for your specific use case.
Fixed-size chunking
The most basic approach divides text into chunks of a specified length without considering con­
tent structure:
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
    separator=" ",   # Split on spaces to avoid breaking words
    chunk_size=200,
    chunk_overlap=20
)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
print(f"Generated {len(chunks)} chunks from document")
Fixed-size chunking is good for quick prototyping or when document structure is relatively uni­
form, however, it often splits text at awkward positions, breaking sentences, paragraphs, or logical
units.
