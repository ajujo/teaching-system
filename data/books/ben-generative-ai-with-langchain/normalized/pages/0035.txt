The Rise of Generative AI: From Language Models to Agents
8
Some models like Llama 2 take a middle ground, offering permissive licenses for both research
and commercial use while maintaining certain usage conditions. For detailed information about
specific model licenses and their implications, refer to the documentation of each model or consult
the model openness framework: https://isitopen.ai/.
In general, open-source licenses promote wide adoption, collaboration, and innovation around
the models, benefiting both research and commercial development. Proprietary licenses typically
give companies exclusive control but may limit academic research progress. Non-commercial
licenses often restrict commercial use while enabling research.
By making knowledge and knowledge work more accessible and adaptable, generative AI mod­
els have the potential to level the playing field and create new opportunities for people from all
walks of life.
The evolution of AI has brought us to a pivotal moment where AI systems can not only process
information but also take autonomous action. The next section explores the transformation from
basic language models to more complex, and finally, fully agentic applications.
From models to agentic applications
As discussed so far, LLMs have been demonstrating remarkable fluency in natural language
processing. However, as impressive as they are, they remain fundamentally reactive rather than
proactive. They lack the ability to take independent actions, interact meaningfully with external
systems, or autonomously achieve complex objectives.
The model openness framework (MOF) evaluates language models based on cri­
teria such as access to model architecture details, training methodology and hy­
perparameters, data sourcing and processing information, documentation around
development decisions, ability to evaluate model workings, biases, and limitations,
code modularity, published model card, availability of servable model, option to run
locally, source code availability, and redistribution rights.

and does not constitute legal advice. Licensing terms vary significantly and evolve
rapidly. Organizations should consult qualified legal counsel regarding specific li­
censing decisions for their AI implementations.
