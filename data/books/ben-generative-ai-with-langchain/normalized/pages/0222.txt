The weather in Munich tomorrow will be 5°C with a 0% chance of rain in the
morning. The wind will blow at 11 km/h. Later in the day, the high will
be 53°F (approximately 12°C). It will be clear in the early morning.
Our agent is represented by a list of messages since this is the input and output that the LLM
expects. We'll see that pattern again when we dive deeper into agentic architectures and discuss
it in the next chapter. For now, let's briefly mention other types of tools that are already available
on LangChain:
•
Tools that enhance the LLM's knowledge besides using a search engine:
•
Academic research: arXiv and PubMed
•
Knowledge bases: Wikipedia and Wikidata
•
Financial data: Alpha Vantage, Polygon, and Yahoo Finance
•
Weather: OpenWeatherMap
•
Computation: Wolfram Alpha
•
Tools that enhance your productivity: You can interact with Gmail, Slack, Office
365, Google Calendar, Jira, Github, etc. For example, GmailToolkit gives you ac­
cess to GmailCreateDraft, GmailSendMessage, GmailSearch, GmailGetMessage, and
GmailGetThread tools that allow you to search, retrieve, create, and send messages with
your Gmail account. As you can see, not only can you give the LLM additional context
about the user but, with some of these tools, LLMs can take actions that actually influ­
ence the outside environment, such as creating a pull request on GitHub or sending a
message on Slack!
•
Tools that give an LLM access to a code interpreter: These tools give LLMs access to
a code interpreter by remotely launching an isolated container and giving LLMs access
to this container. These tools require an API key from a vendor providing the sandboxes.
LLMs are especially good at coding, and it's a widely used pattern to ask an LLM to solve
some complex task by writing code that solves it instead of asking it to generate tokens
that represent the solution of the task. Of course, you should execute code generated by
LLMs with caution, and that's why isolated sandboxes play a huge role. Some examples are:
•
Code execution: Python REPL and Bash
•
Cloud services: AWS Lambda
•
API tools: GraphQL and Requests
•
File operations: File System
