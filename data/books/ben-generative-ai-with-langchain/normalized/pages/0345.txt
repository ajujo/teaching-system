Evaluation and Testing
318
Retrieval quality measures how well the system finds the most appropriate information from
its knowledge base. Rather than using simple relevance scores, modern evaluation approaches
assess retrieval through precision and recall at different ranks, considering both the absolute
relevance of retrieved documents and their coverage of the information needed to answer user
queries. Academic research has developed standardized test collections with expert annotations
to enable systematic comparison across different retrieval methodologies.
Contextual relevance, on the other hand, examines how precisely the retrieved information matches
the specific information need expressed in the query. This involves evaluating whether the system
can distinguish between superficially similar but contextually different information requests.
Recent research has developed specialized evaluation methodologies for testing disambiguation
capabilities in financial contexts, where similar terminology might apply to fundamentally dif­
ferent products or regulations. These approaches specifically measure how well retrieval systems
can distinguish between queries that use similar language but have distinct informational needs.
Faithful generation-the degree to which the agent's responses accurately reflect the retrieved
information without fabricating details-represents perhaps the most critical aspect of RAG eval­
uation. Recent studies have found that even well-optimized RAG systems still show non-trivial
hallucination rates, between 3-15% on complex domains, highlighting the ongoing challenge in
this area. Researchers have developed various evaluation protocols for faithfulness, including
source attribution tests and contradiction detection mechanisms that systematically compare
generated content with the retrieved source material.
Finally, information synthesis quality evaluates the agent's ability to integrate information from
multiple sources into coherent, well-structured responses. Rather than simply concatenating or
paraphrasing individual documents, advanced agents must reconcile potentially conflicting in­
formation, present balanced perspectives, and organize content logically. Evaluation here extends
beyond automated metrics to include expert assessment of how effectively the agent has synthe­
sized complex information into accessible, accurate summaries that maintain appropriate nuance.
Planning and reasoning evaluation
Planning and reasoning capabilities form the cognitive foundation that enables agents to solve
complex, multi-step problems that cannot be addressed through single operations. Evaluating
these capabilities requires moving beyond simple input-output testing to assess the quality of
the agent's thought process and problem-solving strategy.
