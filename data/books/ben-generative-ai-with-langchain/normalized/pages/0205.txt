Building Intelligent RAG Systems
178
These strategies build a more reliable, transparent, and production-ready RAG application that
not only generates content but also explains its sources. Further performance and observability
strategies will be covered in Chapter 8.
Building an effective RAG system means understanding its common failure points and addressing
them with quantitative and testing-based strategies. In the next section, we'll explore the typical
failure points and best practices in relation to RAG systems.
Troubleshooting RAG systems
Barnett and colleagues in their paper Seven Failure Points When Engineering a Retrieval Augmented
Generation System (2024), and Li and colleagues in their paper Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented
Generation: A Study of Best Practices (2025) emphasize the importance of both robust design and
continuous system calibration:
•
Foundational setup: Ensure comprehensive and high-quality document collections, clear
prompt formulations, and effective retrieval techniques that enhance precision and rel­
evance.
•
Continuous calibration: Regular monitoring, user feedback, and updates to the knowl­
edge base help identify emerging issues during operation.
By implementing these practices early in development, many common RAG failures can be pre­
vented. However, even well-designed systems encounter issues. The following sections explore
the seven most common failure points identified by Barnett and colleagues (2024) and provide
targeted solutions informed by empirical research.
A few common failure points and their remedies are as follows:
•
Missing content: Failure occurs when the system lacks relevant documents. Prevent this
by validating content during ingestion and adding domain-specific resources. Use explicit
signals to indicate when information is unavailable.
•
Missed top-ranked documents: Even with relevant documents available, poor ranking
can lead to their exclusion. Improve this with advanced embedding models, hybrid se­
mantic-lexical searches, and sentence-level retrieval.
•
Context window limitations: When key information is spread across documents that
exceed the model's context limit, it may be truncated. Mitigate this by optimizing docu­
ment chunking and extracting the most relevant sentences.
