First Steps with LangChain
54
Having explored how to build text-based applications with LangChain, we'll now extend our
understanding to multimodal capabilities. As AI systems increasingly work with multiple forms
of data, LangChain provides interfaces for both generating images from text and understanding
visual content - capabilities that complement the text processing we've already covered and open
new possibilities for more immersive applications.
Multimodal AI applications
AI systems have evolved beyond text-only processing to work with diverse data types. In the
current landscape, we can distinguish between two key capabilities that are often confused but
represent different technological approaches.
Multimodal understanding represents the ability of models to process multiple types of inputs
simultaneously to perform reasoning and generate responses. These advanced systems can un­
derstand the relationships between different modalities, accepting inputs like text, images, PDFs,
audio, video, and structured data. Their processing capabilities include cross-modal reasoning,
context awareness, and sophisticated information extraction. Models like Gemini 2.5, GPT-4V,
Sonnet 3.7, and Llama 4 exemplify this capability. For instance, a multimodal model can analyze
a chart image along with a text question to provide insights about the data trend, combining
visual and textual understanding in a single processing flow.
Content generation capabilities, by contrast, focus on creating specific types of media, often with
extraordinary quality but more specialized functionality. Text-to-image models create visual
content from descriptions, text-to-video systems generate video clips from prompts, text-toaudio tools produce music or speech, and image-to-image models transform existing visuals.
Examples include Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion for images; Sora and Pika for video;
and Suno and ElevenLabs for audio. Unlike true multimodal models, many generation systems
are specialized for their specific output modality, even if they can accept multiple input types.
They excel at creation rather than understanding.
As LLMs evolve beyond text, LangChain is expanding to support both multimodal understanding
and content generation workflows. The framework provides developers with tools to incorpo­
rate these advanced capabilities into their applications without needing to implement complex
integrations from scratch. Let's start with generating images from text descriptions. LangChain
provides several approaches to incorporate image generation through external integrations and
wrappers. We'll explore multiple implementation patterns, starting with the simplest and pro­
gressing to more sophisticated techniques that can be incorporated into your applications.
