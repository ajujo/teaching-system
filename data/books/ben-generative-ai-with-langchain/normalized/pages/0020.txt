Chapter 5, Building Intelligent Agents, tackles tool use fragility-identified as a core bottleneck
in agent autonomy. You'll implement the ReACT pattern to improve agent reasoning and deci­
sion-making, develop robust custom tools, and build error-resilient tool calling processes. Through
practical examples like generating structured outputs and building a research agent, you'll under­
stand what agents are and implement your first plan-and-solve agent with LangGraph, setting
the stage for more advanced agent architectures.
Chapter 6, Advanced Applications and Multi-Agent Systems, covers architectural patterns for agentic
AI applications. You'll explore multi-agent architectures and ways to organize communication
between agents, implementing an advanced agent with self-reflection that uses tools to an­
swer complex questions. The chapter also covers LangGraph streaming, advanced control flows,
adaptive systems with humans in the loop, and the Tree-of-Thoughts pattern. You'll learn about
memory mechanisms in LangChain and LangGraph, including caches and stores, equipping you
to create systems capable of tackling problems too complex for single-agent approaches-a key
capability of production-ready systems.
Chapter 7, Software Development and Data Analysis Agents, demonstrates how natural language has
become a powerful interface for programming and data analysis. You'll implement LLM-based
solutions for code generation, code retrieval with RAG, and documentation search. These examples
show how to integrate LLM agents into existing development and data workflows, illustrating
how they complement rather than replace traditional programming skills.
Chapter 8, Evaluation and Testing, outlines methodologies for assessing LLM applications before
production deployment. You'll learn about system-level evaluation, evaluation-driven design,
and both offline and online methods. The chapter provides practical examples for implementing
correctness evaluation using exact matches and LLM-as-a-judge approaches and demonstrates
tools like LangSmith for comprehensive testing and monitoring. These techniques directly increase
reliability and help justify the business value of your LLM applications.
Chapter 9, Observability and Production Deployment, provides guidelines for deploying LLM appli­
cations into production, focusing on system design, scaling strategies, monitoring, and ensuring
high availability. The chapter covers logging, API design, cost optimization, and redundancy
strategies specific to LLMs. You'll explore the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and learn how to
implement observability practices that address the unique challenges of deploying generative AI
systems. The practical deployment patterns in this chapter help you avoid common pitfalls that
prevent many LLM projects from reaching production.
