•
Information extraction failure: Sometimes, the LLM fails to synthesize the available con­
text properly. This can be resolved by refining prompt design-using explicit instructions
and contrastive examples enhances extraction accuracy.
•
Format compliance issues: Answers may be correct but delivered in the wrong format
(e.g., incorrect table or JSON structure). Enforce structured output with parsers, precise
format examples, and post-processing validation.
•
Specificity mismatch: The output may be too general or too detailed. Address this by using
query expansion techniques and tailoring prompts based on the user's expertise level.
•
Incomplete information: Answers might capture only a portion of the necessary details.
Increase retrieval diversity (e.g., using maximum marginal relevance) and refine query
transformation methods to cover all aspects of the query.
Integrating focused retrieval methods, such as retrieving documents first and then extracting key
sentences, has been shown to improve performance-even bridging some gaps caused by smaller
model sizes. Continuous testing and prompt engineering remain essential to maintaining system
quality as operational conditions evolve.
Summary
In this chapter, we explored the key aspects of RAG, including vector storage, document pro­
cessing, retrieval strategies, and implementation. Following this, we built a comprehensive RAG
chatbot that leverages LangChain for LLM interactions and LangGraph for state management and
workflow orchestration. This is a prime example of how you can design modular, maintainable,
and user-friendly LLM applications that not only generate creative outputs but also incorporate
dynamic feedback loops.
This foundation opens the door to more advanced RAG systems, whether you're retrieving doc­
uments, enhancing context, or tailoring outputs to meet specific user needs. As you continue to
develop production-ready LLM applications, consider how these patterns can be adapted and
extended to suit your requirements. In Chapter 8, we'll be discussing how to benchmark and
quantify the performance of RAG systems to ensure performance is up to requirements.
In the next chapter, we will build on this foundation by introducing intelligent agents that can
utilize tools for enhanced interactions. We will cover various tool integration strategies, structured
tool output generation, and agent architectures such as ReACT. This will allow us to develop more
capable AI systems that can dynamically interact with external resources.
