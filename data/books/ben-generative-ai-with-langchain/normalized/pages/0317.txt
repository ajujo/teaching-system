Software Development and Data Analysis Agents
290
The agent will:
1.
Determine what it needs to write Python code.
2.
Use PythonREPLTool to execute the code.
3.
Return the results.
When run, it will show its reasoning steps and code execution before giving the final answer. We
should be seeing an output like this:
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
I can write a Python script to find the prime numbers up to 20.
Action: Python_REPL
Action Input: def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
primes = [num for num in range(2, 21) if is_prime(num)]
print(primes)
Observation: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
I now know the final answer
Final Answer: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
> Finished chain.
{'input': 'What are the prime numbers until 20?', 'output': '[2, 3, 5, 7,
11, 13, 17, 19]'}
Documentation RAG
What is also quite interesting is the use of documents to help write code or to ask questions
about documentation. Here's an example of loading all documentation pages from LangChain's
website using DocusaurusLoader:
from langchain_community.document_loaders import DocusaurusLoader
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()
