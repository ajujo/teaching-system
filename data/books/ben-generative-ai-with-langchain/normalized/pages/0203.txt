Column 2 takes the files and gives them to the retriever:
with col2:
    st.subheader("Document Management")
    # File uploader
    uploaded_files = st.file_uploader(
        "Upload Documents",
        type=list(DocumentLoader.supported_extensions),
        accept_multiple_files=True
    )
    if uploaded_files:
        for file in uploaded_files:
            if file.name not in st.session_state.uploaded_files:
                st.session_state.uploaded_files.append(file)
To run our Corporate Documentation Manager application on Linux or macOS, follow these steps:
1.
Open your terminal and change directory to where your project files are. This ensures that
the chapter4/ directory is accessible.
2.
Set PYTHONPATH and run Streamlit. The imports within the project rely on the current
directory being in the Python module search path. Therefore, we'll set PYTHONPATH when
we run Streamlit:
PYTHONPATH=. streamlit run chapter4/streamlit_app.py
The preceding command tells Python to look in the current directory for modules, allowing
it to find the chapter4 package.
3.
Once the command runs successfully, Streamlit will start a web server. Open your web
browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to use the application.
