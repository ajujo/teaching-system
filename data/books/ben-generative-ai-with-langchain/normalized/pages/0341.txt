Evaluation and Testing
314
End users evaluate agents primarily through the lens of practical task completion and interaction
quality. Their assessment revolves around the agent's ability to understand and fulfill requests
accurately (task success rate), respond with relevant information (answer relevancy), maintain
conversation coherence, and operate with reasonable speed (response time). This group values
satisfaction metrics most highly, with user satisfaction scores and communication efficiency
being particularly important in conversational contexts. In application-specific domains like web
navigation or software engineering, users may prioritize domain-specific success metrics-such
as whether an e-commerce agent successfully completed a purchase or a coding agent resolved
a software issue correctly.
Technical stakeholders require a deeper evaluation of the agent's internal processes rather than
just outcomes. They focus on the quality of planning (plan feasibility, plan optimality), reason­
ing coherence, tool selection accuracy, and adherence to technical constraints. For SWE agents,
metrics like code correctness and test case passing rate are critical. Technical teams also closely
monitor computational efficiency metrics such as token consumption, latency, and resource uti­
lization, as these directly impact operating costs and scalability. Their evaluation extends to the
agent's robustness-measuring how it handles edge cases, recovers from errors, and performs
under varying loads.
Business stakeholders evaluate agents through metrics connecting directly to organizational
value. Beyond basic ROI calculations, they track domain-specific KPIs that demonstrate tangible
impact: reduced call center volume for customer service agents, improved inventory accuracy for
retail applications, or decreased downtime for manufacturing agents. Their evaluation framework
includes the agent's alignment with strategic goals, competitive differentiation, and scalability
across the organization. In sectors like finance, metrics bridging technical performance to busi­
ness outcomes-such as reduced fraud losses while maintaining customer convenience-are
especially valuable.
Regulatory stakeholders, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and legal
services, evaluate agents through strict compliance and safety lenses. Their assessment encom­
passes the agent's adherence to domain-specific regulations (like HIPAA in healthcare or financial
regulations in banking), bias detection measures, robustness against adversarial inputs, and
comprehensive documentation of decision processes. For these stakeholders, the thoroughness
of safety testing and the agent's consistent performance within defined guardrails outweigh pure
efficiency or capability metrics. As autonomous agents gain wider deployment, this regulatory
evaluation dimension becomes increasingly crucial to ensure ethical operation and minimize
potential harm.
