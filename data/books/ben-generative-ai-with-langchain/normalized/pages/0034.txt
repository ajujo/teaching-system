Table 1.2: Comparative overview of major LLM providers and their flagship models for
LangChain implementation
Other organizations develop LLMs but do not necessarily provide them through application
programming interfaces (APIs) to developers. For example, Meta AI develops the very influential
Llama model series, which has strong reasoning, code-generation capabilities, and is released
under an open-source license.
There is a whole zoo of open-source models that you can access through Hugging Face or through
other providers. You can even download these open-source models, fine-tune them, or fully train
them. We'll try this out practically starting in Chapter 2.
Once you've selected an appropriate model, the next crucial step is understanding how to control
its behavior to suit your specific application needs. While accessing a model gives you computa­
tional capability, it's the choice of generation parameters that transforms raw model power into
tailored output for different use cases within your applications.
Now that we've covered the LLM provider landscape, let's discuss another critical aspect of LLM
implementation: licensing considerations. The licensing terms of different models significantly
impact how you can use them in your applications.
Licensing
LLMs are available under different licensing models that impact how they can be used in practice.
Open-source models like Mixtral and BERT can be freely used, modified, and integrated into
applications. These models allow developers to run them locally, investigate their behavior, and
build upon them for both research and commercial purposes.
In contrast, proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude are accessible only through APIs, with their
internal workings kept private. While this ensures consistent performance and regular updates,
it means depending on external services and typically incurring usage costs.
