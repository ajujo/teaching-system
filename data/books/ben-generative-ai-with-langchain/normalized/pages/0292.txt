On the other side, when using search, we can use a partial namespace path:
print(len(in_memory_store.search(("users", "user1", "conv1"),
query="name")))
print(len(in_memory_store.search(("users", "user1"), query="name")))

As you can see, we were able to retrieve all relevant facts stored in memory by using a partial search.
LangGraph has built-in InMemoryStore and PostgresStore implementations. Agentic memory
mechanisms are still evolving. You can build your own implementation from available compo­
nents, but we should see a lot of progress in the coming years or even months.
Summary
In this chapter, we dived deep into advanced applications of LLMs and the architectural patterns
that enable them, leveraging LangChain and LangGraph. The key takeaway is that effectively
building complex AI systems goes beyond simply prompting an LLM; it requires careful architec­
tural design of the workflow itself, tool usage, and giving an LLM partial control over the workflow.
We also discussed different agentic AI design patterns and how to develop agents that leverage
LLMs' tool-calling abilities to solve complex tasks.
We explored how LangGraph streaming works and how to control what information is streamed
back during execution. We discussed the difference between streaming state updates and partial
streaming answer tokens, learned about the Command interface as a way to hand off execution
to a specific node within or outside the current LangGraph workflow, looked at the LangGraph
platform and its main capabilities, and discussed how to implement HIL with LangGraph. We
discussed how a thread on LangGraph differs from a traditional Pythonic definition (a thread is
somewhat similar to a conversation instance), and we learned how to add memory to our workflow
per-thread and with cross-thread persistence. Finally, we learned how to expand beyond basic
LLM applications and build robust, adaptive, and intelligent systems by leveraging the advanced
capabilities of LangChain and LangGraph.
In the next chapter, we'll take a look at how generative AI transforms the software engineering
industry by assisting in code development and data analysis.
