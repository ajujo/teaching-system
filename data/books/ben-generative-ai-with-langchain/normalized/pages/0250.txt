Advanced Applications and
Multi-Agent Systems
In the previous chapter, we defined what an agent is. But how do we design and build a high-per­
forming agent? Unlike the prompt engineering techniques we've previously explored, develop­
ing effective agents involves several distinct design patterns every developer should be familiar
with. In this chapter, we're going to discuss key architectural patterns behind agentic AI. We'll
look into multi-agentic architectures and the ways to organize communication between agents.
We will develop an advanced agent with self-reflection that uses tools to answer complex exam
questions. We will learn about additional LangChain and LangGraph APIs that are useful when
implementing agentic architectures, such as details about LangGraph streaming and ways to
implement handoff as part of advanced control flows.
Then, we'll briefly touch on the LangGraph platform and discuss how to develop adaptive systems,
by including humans in the loop, and what kind of prebuilt building blocks LangGraph offers for
this. We will also look into the Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) pattern and develop a ToT agent ourselves,
discussing further ways to improve it by implementing advanced trimming mechanisms. Finally,
we'll learn about advanced long-term memory mechanisms on LangChain and LangGraph, such
as caches and stores.
