Table 10.2: State of sector-specific automation levels and projections
This data supports a nuanced view of automation timelines across different sectors. While man­
ufacturing and logistics are progressing rapidly toward high levels of automation, service sectors
with complex human interactions face more significant barriers.
Earlier McKinsey estimates from 2023 suggested that LLMs could directly automate 20% of tasks
and indirectly transform 50% of tasks. However, implementation has proven more challenging
than anticipated. The most successful deployments have been those that augment human capa­
bilities rather than attempt full replacement.
Industry-specific transformations and competitive dynamics
 The competitive landscape for AI providers has evolved significantly in 2024-2025. Price com­
petition has intensified as technical capabilities converge across vendors, putting pressure on
profit margins throughout the industry. Companies face challenges in establishing sustainable
competitive advantages beyond their core technology, as differentiation increasingly depends on
domain expertise, solution integration, and service quality rather than raw model performance.
Corporate adoption rates remain modest compared to initial projections, suggesting that massive
infrastructure investments made under the scaling hypothesis may struggle to generate adequate
returns in the near term.
Leading manufacturing adopters-such as the Global Lighthouse factories-already automate
50-80% of tasks using AI-powered robotics, achieving ROI within 2-3 years. According to ABI
Research's 2023 Collaborative Robot Market Analysis (https://www.abiresearch.com/press/
collaborative-robots-pioneer-automation-revolution-market-to-reach-us7.2-billionby-2030), collaborative robots are experiencing faster deployment times than traditional indus­
trial robots, with implementation periods averaging 30-40% shorter. However, these advances
remain primarily effective in structured environments. The gap between pioneering facilities
and the industry average (currently at 45-50% automation) illustrates both the potential and
the implementation challenges ahead.
