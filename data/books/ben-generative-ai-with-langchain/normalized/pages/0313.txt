Notice how the model not only implemented the requested calculate_primes() function but also
created a helper function, is_prime(), which uses a more efficient algorithm checking divisibil­
ity only up to the square root of the number. The model even added a complete main() function
with user input handling, demonstrating its understanding of Python programming patterns.
Instead of downloading and running models locally, which requires significant computational
resources, we can also run models directly on Hugging Face's infrastructure using their Inference
API. This approach is simpler to set up and doesn't require powerful hardware. Here's how to
implement the same example using Hugging Face's hosted services:
from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceHub
# Choose a lightweight model good for code generation
repo_id = "bigcode/starcoder"
# Initialize the HuggingFaceHub LLM
llm = HuggingFaceHub(
    repo_id=repo_id,
