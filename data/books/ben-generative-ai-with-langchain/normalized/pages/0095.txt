Building Workflows with LangGraph
68
LangGraph fundamentals
LangGraph is a framework developed by LangChain (as a company) that helps control and or­
chestrate workflows. Why do we need another orchestration framework? Let's park this question
until Chapter 5, where we'll touch on agents and agentic workflows, but for now, let us mention
the flexibility of LangGraph as an orchestration framework and its robustness in handling com­
plex scenarios.
Unlike many other frameworks, LangGraph allows cycles (most other orchestration frameworks
operate only with directly acyclic graphs), supports streaming out of the box, and has many
pre-built loops and components dedicated to generative AI applications (for example, human
moderation). LangGraph also has a very rich API that allows you to have very granular control
of your execution flow if needed. This is not fully covered in our book, but just keep in mind that
you can always use a more low-level API if you need to.
For now, let's start with the basics. If you're new to this framework, we would also highly recom­
mend a free online course on LangGraph that is available at https://academy.langchain.com/
to deepen your understanding.
As always, you can find all the code samples on our public GitHub repository as Jupy­
ter notebooks: https://github.com/benman1/generative_ai_with_langchain/

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a special type of graph in graph theory and com­
puter science. Its edges (connections between nodes) have a direction, which means
that the connection from node A to node B is different from the connection from
node B to node A. It has no cycles. In other words, there is no path that starts at a
node and returns to the same node by following the directed edges.
DAGs are often used as a model of workflows in data engineering, where nodes are
tasks and edges are dependencies between these tasks. For example, an edge from
node A to node B means that we need output from node A to execute node B.
