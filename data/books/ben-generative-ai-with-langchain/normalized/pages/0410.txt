Look at your data requirements first: If you're handling medical records, financial data, or
other regulated information, you'll likely need self-hosting. For less sensitive data, cloud
APIs are simpler and faster to implement.
•
On-premises when you need complete control: Choose on-premises deployment when
you need absolute data sovereignty or have strict security requirements. Be ready for seri­
ous hardware costs ($50K-$300K for server setups), dedicated MLOps staff, and physical
infrastructure management. The upside is complete control over your models and data,
with no per-token fees.
•
Cloud self-hosting for the middle ground: Running models on cloud GPU instances gives
you most of the control benefits without managing physical hardware. You'll still need
staff who understand ML infrastructure, but you'll save on physical setup costs and can
scale more easily than with on-premises hardware.
•
Try hybrid approaches for complex needs: Route sensitive data to your self-hosted models
while sending general queries to cloud APIs. This gives you the best of both worlds but
adds complexity. You'll need clear routing rules and monitoring at both ends. Common
patterns include:
•
Sending public data to cloud APIs and private data to your own servers
•
Using cloud APIs for general tasks and self-hosted models for specialized domains
•
Running base workloads on your hardware and bursting to cloud APIs during
traffic spikes
•
Be honest about your customization needs: If you need to deeply modify how the model
works, you'll need self-hosted open-source models. If standard prompting works for your
use case, cloud APIs will save you significant time and resources.
•
Calculate your usage realistically: High, steady volume makes self-hosting more cost-ef­
fective over time. Unpredictable or spiky usage patterns work better with cloud APIs where
you only pay for what you use. Run the numbers before deciding.
•
Assess your team's skills truthfully: On-premises deployment requires hardware ex­
pertise on top of ML knowledge. Cloud self-hosting requires strong container and cloud
infrastructure skills. Hybrid setups demand all these plus integration experience. If you
lack these skills, budget for hiring or start with simpler cloud APIs.
•
Consider your timeline: Cloud APIs let you launch in days rather than months. Many
successful products start with cloud APIs to test their idea, then move to self-hosting
once they've proven it works and have the volume to justify it.
