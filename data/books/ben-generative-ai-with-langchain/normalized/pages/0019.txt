Preface

For technical decision-makers evaluating LLM technologies within their organizations, this book
offers strategic insight into successful LLM project implementations. You'll understand the ar­
chitectural patterns that differentiate experimental systems from production-ready ones, learn
to identify high-value use cases, and discover how to avoid the integration and scaling issues
that cause most projects to fail. The book provides clear criteria for evaluating implementation
approaches and making informed technology decisions.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, The Rise of Generative AI, From Language Models to Agents, introduces the modern LLM
landscape and positions LangChain as the framework for building production-ready AI applica­
tions. You'll learn about the practical limitations of basic LLMs and how frameworks like LangC­
hain help with standardization and overcoming these challenges. This foundation will help you
make informed decisions about which agent technologies to implement for your specific use cases.
Chapter 2, First Steps with LangChain, gets you building immediately with practical, hands-on exam­
ples. You'll set up a proper development environment, understand LangChain's core components
(model interfaces, prompts, templates, and LCEL), and create simple chains. The chapter shows
you how to run both cloud-based and local models, giving you options to balance cost, privacy,
and performance based on your project needs. You'll also explore simple multimodal applications
that combine text with visual understanding. These fundamentals provide the building blocks
for increasingly sophisticated AI applications.
Chapter 3, Building Workflows with LangGraph, dives into creating complex workflows with LangC­
hain and LangGraph. You'll learn to build workflows with nodes and edges, including conditional
edges for branching based on state. The chapter covers output parsing, error handling, prompt
engineering techniques (zero-shot and dynamic few-shot prompting), and working with long
contexts using Map-Reduce patterns. You'll also implement memory mechanisms for managing
chat history. These skills address why many LLM applications fail in real-world conditions and
give you the tools to build systems that perform reliably.
Chapter 4, Building Intelligent RAG Systems, addresses the "hallucination problem" by ground­
ing LLMs in reliable external knowledge. You'll master vector stores, document processing, and
retrieval strategies that improve response accuracy. The chapter's corporate documentation
chatbot project demonstrates how to implement enterprise-grade RAG pipelines that maintain
consistency and compliance-a capability that directly addresses data quality concerns cited
in industry surveys. The troubleshooting section covers seven common RAG failure points and
provides practical solutions for each.
