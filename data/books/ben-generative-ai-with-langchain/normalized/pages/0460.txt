Hugging Face
Hugging Face is a very prominent player in the NLP space and has considerable traction in opensource and hosting solutions. The company is a French American company that develops tools for
building ML applications. Its employees develop and maintain the Transformers Python library,
which is used for NLP tasks, includes implementations of state-of-the-art and popular models
like Mistral 7B, BERT, and GPT-2, and is compatible with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.
In addition to their products, Hugging Face has been involved in initiatives such as the BigScience
Research Workshop, where they released an open LLM called BLOOM with 176 billion parameters.
Hugging Face has also established partnerships with companies like Graphcore and Amazon
Web Services to optimize their offerings and make them available to a broader customer base.
LangChain supports leveraging the Hugging Face Hub, which provides access to a massive num­
ber of models, datasets in various languages and formats, and demo apps. This includes inte­
grations with Hugging Face Endpoints, enabling text generation inference powered by the Text
Generation Inference service. Users can connect to different Endpoint types, including the free
Serverless Endpoints API and dedicated Inference Endpoints for enterprise workloads that come
with support for AutoScaling.
For local use, LangChain provides integration with Hugging Face models and pipelines. The
ChatHuggingFace class allows using Hugging Face models for chat applications, while the
HuggingFacePipeline class enables running Hugging Face models locally through pipe­
lines. Additionally, LangChain supports embedding models from Hugging Face, including
HuggingFaceEmbeddings, HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings, and HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings.
The HuggingFaceHubEmbeddings class allows leveraging the Hugging Face Text Embed­
dings Inference (TEI) toolkit for high-performance extraction. LangChain also provides a
HuggingFaceDatasetLoader to load datasets from the Hugging Face Hub.
