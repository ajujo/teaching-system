Production-Ready LLM Deployment and Observability
350
Let's begin by examining security considerations and strategies for protecting LLM applications
in production environments.
Security considerations for LLM applications
LLMs introduce new security challenges that traditional web or application security measures
weren't designed to handle. Standard controls often fail against attacks unique to LLMs, and
recent incidents-from prompt leaking in commercial chatbots to hallucinated legal citationshighlight the need for dedicated defenses.
LLM applications differ fundamentally from conventional software because they accept both
system instructions and user data through the same text channel, produce nondeterministic out­
puts, and manage context in ways that can expose or mix up sensitive information. For example,
attackers have extracted hidden system prompts by simply asking some models to repeat their
instructions, and firms have suffered from models inventing fictitious legal precedents. Moreover,
simple pattern‐matching filters can be bypassed by cleverly rephrased malicious inputs, making
semantic‐aware defenses essential.
Recognizing these risks, OWASP has called out several key vulnerabilities in LLM deploymentschief among them being prompt injection, which can hijack the model's behavior by embedding
harmful directives in user inputs. Refer to OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications for a comprehensive
list of common security risks and best practices: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-forlarge-language-model-applications/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.
