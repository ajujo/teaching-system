Chapter 2

This capability opens numerous possibilities for LangChain applications. By combining image
analysis with the text processing patterns we explored earlier in this chapter, you can build so­
phisticated applications that reason across modalities. In the next chapter, we'll build on these
concepts to create more sophisticated multimodal applications.
Summary
After setting up our development environment and configuring necessary API keys, we've ex­
plored the foundations of LangChain development, from basic chains to multimodal capabilities.
We've seen how LCEL simplifies complex workflows and how LangChain integrates with both
text and image processing. These building blocks prepare us for more advanced applications in
the coming chapters.
In the next chapter, we'll expand on these concepts to create more sophisticated multimodal
applications with enhanced control flow, structured outputs, and advanced prompt techniques.
You'll learn how to combine multiple modalities in complex chains, incorporate more sophis­
ticated error handling, and build applications that leverage the full potential of modern LLMs.
