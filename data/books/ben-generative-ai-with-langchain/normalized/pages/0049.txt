The Rise of Generative AI: From Language Models to Agents
22
These extensions, along with the core framework, provide a comprehensive ecosystem for devel­
oping, managing, and visualizing LLM applications, each with unique capabilities that enhance
functionality and user experience.
LangChain also has an extensive array of tool integrations, which we'll discuss in detail in Chapter
5. New integrations are added regularly, expanding the framework's capabilities across domains.
Third-party applications and visual tools
Many third-party applications have been built on top of or around LangChain. For example,
LangFlow and Flowise introduce visual interfaces for LLM development, with UIs that allow for
the drag-and-drop assembly of LangChain components into executable workflows. This visual
approach enables rapid prototyping and experimentation, lowering the barrier to entry for com­
plex pipeline creation, as illustrated in the following screenshot of Flowise:
