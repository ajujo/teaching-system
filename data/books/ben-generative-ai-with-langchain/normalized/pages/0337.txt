Evaluation and Testing
310
In the realm of developing LLM agents, evaluations play a pivotal role in ensuring these complex
systems function reliably and effectively across real-world applications. Let's start discussing
why rigorous evaluation is indispensable!
Why evaluation matters
LLM agents represent a new class of AI systems that combine language models with reasoning,
decision-making, and tool-using capabilities. Unlike traditional software with predictable behav­
iors, these agents operate with greater autonomy and complexity, making thorough evaluation
essential before deployment.
Consider the real-world consequences: unlike traditional software with deterministic behavior,
LLM agents make complex, context-dependent decisions. If unevaluated before being implement­
ed, an AI agent in customer support might provide misleading information that damages brand
reputation, while a healthcare assistant could influence critical treatment decisions-highlighting
why thorough evaluation is essential.
You can find the code for this chapter in the chapter8/ directory of the book's GitHub
repository. Given the rapid developments in the field and the updates to the Lang­
Chain library, we are committed to keeping the GitHub repository current. Please

latest updates.
See Chapter 2 for setup instructions. If you have any questions or encounter issues
while running the code, please create an issue on GitHub or join the discussion on

Before diving into specific evaluation techniques, it's important to distinguish be­
tween two fundamentally different types of evaluation:
LLM model evaluation:
•
Focuses on the raw capabilities of the base language model
•
Uses controlled prompts and standardized benchmarks
•
Evaluates inherent abilities like reasoning, knowledge recall, and language
generation
•
Typically conducted by model developers or researchers comparing different
models
