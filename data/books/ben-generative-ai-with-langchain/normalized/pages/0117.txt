Building Workflows with LangGraph

Figure 3.4: An example of a workflow with a dynamic retrieval of examples to be passed to
a few-shot prompt
There are a few already built-in selectors under langchain_core.example_selectors. You can
directly pass an instance of an example selector to the FewShotPromptTemplate instance during
instantiation.
Chain of Thought
The Google Research team introduced the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique early in 2022. They
demonstrated that a relatively simple modification to a prompt that encouraged a model to gen­
erate intermediate step-by-step reasoning steps significantly increased the LLM's performance
on complex symbolic reasoning, common sense, and math tasks. Such an increase in performance
has been replicated multiple times since then.
There are different modifications of CoT prompting, and because it has long outputs, typically,
CoT prompts are zero-shot. You add instructions that encourage an LLM to think about the
problem first instead of immediately generating tokens representing the answer. A very simple
example of CoT is just to add to your prompt template something like "Let's think step by step."
