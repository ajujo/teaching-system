The Future of Generative Models: Beyond Scaling
422
In creative industries, we're seeing progress in specific domains. Software development tools like
GitHub Copilot are changing how developers work, though specific percentages of task automa­
tion remain difficult to quantify precisely. Similarly, data analysis tools are increasingly handling
routine tasks across finance and marketing, though the exact extent varies widely by implementa­
tion. According to McKinsey Global Institute's 2017 research, only about 5% of occupations could
be fully automated by demonstrated technologies, while many more have significant portions
of automatable activities (approximately 30% of activities automatable in 60% of occupations).
This suggests that most successful implementations are augmenting rather than completely
replacing human capabilities.
Job evolution and skills implications
As automation adoption progresses across industries, the impact on jobs will vary significantly
by sector and timeline. Based on current adoption rates and projections, we can anticipate how
specific roles will evolve.
Near-term impacts (2025-2035)
As automation adoption progresses across industries, the impact on jobs will vary significantly
by sector and timeline. While precise automation percentages are difficult to predict, we can
identify clear patterns in how specific roles are likely to evolve.
According to McKinsey Global Institute research, only about 5% of occupations could be fully au­
tomated with current technologies, though about 60% of occupations have at least 30% of their
constituent activities that could be automated. This suggests that job transformation-rather
than wholesale replacement-will be the predominant pattern as AI capabilities advance. The
most successful implementations to date have augmented human capabilities rather than fully
replacing workers.
The automation potential varies substantially across sectors. Manufacturing and logistics, with
their structured environments and repetitive tasks, show higher potential for automation than
sectors requiring complex human interaction like healthcare and education. This differential
creates an uneven timeline for transformation across the economy.
Medium-term impacts (2035-2045)
As service sectors reach 40-60% automation levels over the next decade, we can expect significant
transformations in traditional professional roles:
