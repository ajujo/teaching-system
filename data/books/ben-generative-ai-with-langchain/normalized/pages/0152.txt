This example demonstrates the fundamental tradeoff in vector indexing: exact search guarantees
finding the true nearest neighbors but takes longer, while HNSW provides approximate results
significantly faster. The overlap percentage shows how many of the same nearest neighbors were
found by both methods.
For small datasets like this example (10,000 vectors), the absolute time difference is minimal.
However, as your dataset grows to millions or billions of vectors, exact search becomes prohib­
itively expensive, while HNSW maintains logarithmic scaling-making approximate indexing
methods essential for production RAG systems.
Here's a diagram that can help developers choose the right indexing strategy based on their
requirements:
