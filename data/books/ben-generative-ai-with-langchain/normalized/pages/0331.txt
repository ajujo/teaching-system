 This dataset contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal
length, and petal width) and 150 entries.
Final Answer: Based on the observation, this dataset is likely about mea­
surements of flower characteristics.

'Based on the observation, this dataset is likely about measurements of
flower characteristics.'
This initial query demonstrates how the agent can perform basic data exploration by checking
the structure and first few rows of the dataset. Notice how it correctly identifies that the data
contains flower measurements, even without explicit species labels in the preview. Next, let's
challenge our agent with a more analytical question that requires computation:
agent.run(prompt.format(query="Which row has the biggest difference be­
tween petal length and petal width?"))
The agent tackles this by creating a new calculated column and finding its maximum value:
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: First, we need to find the difference between petal length and
petal width for each row. Then, we need to find the row with the maximum
difference.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df['petal_diff'] = df['petal length (cm)'] - df['petal width
(cm)']
              df['petal_diff'].max()
Observation: 4.7
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df['petal_diff'].idxmax()
Observation: 122
