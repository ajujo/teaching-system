The returned score and reasoning allow us to judge whether the agent's thought process is sound
and comprehensive:
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Evaluation:
{'reasoning': "The student correctly identified the current Federal
Reserve interest rate as 0.25%. They also correctly explained why this
rate matters, stating that it is intended to stimulate economic growth by
keeping borrowing costs low, which in turn encourages consumer spending
and business investment. This explanation aligns with the context
provided, which asked for a brief explanation of the implications for
borrowing costs and consumer spending. Therefore, the student's answer is
factually accurate.\nGRADE: CORRECT", 'value': 'CORRECT', 'score': 1}
Please note that in this evaluation, the agent provides detailed reasoning along with its answer.
The evaluator (using chain-of-thought evaluation) compares the agent's reasoning with an ex­
pected explanation.
