We get an algorithm and a very detailed explanation:
To calculate the prime numbers up to a given number N, we can follow the
Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve
the problem:
```python
def calculate_primes(n):
    """Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 up to N."""
    # Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to N
    numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))
    # Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
    primes = []
    while numbers:
        # Take the first number as prime
        prime = numbers[0]
        primes.append(prime)
        # Remove all multiples of the prime number from the list
        numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % prime != 0]
    return primes
```
Step-by-step explanation:
We create a list called `numbers` that contains consecutive integers from 2
to N using the `range()` function.
We initialize an empty list called `primes` to store the prime numbers that
we will calculate.
We start a loop that continues as long as there are numbers in the `numbers`
list.
Inside the loop, we take the first number from the `numbers` list and con­
sider it as a prime number. We append this prime number to the `primes`
list.
We remove all the multiples of the prime number from the `numbers` list us­
ing a list comprehension. The list comprehension creates a new list contain­
ing only the numbers that are not divisible by the current prime number.
