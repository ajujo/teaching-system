To the mentors who guided me throughout my life-especially Tony Lindeberg, whose personal
integrity and perseverance are a tremendous source of inspiration-and to my son, Nicholas,
and my partner, Diane.
-Ben Auffarth
To my wife, Ksenia, whose unwavering love and optimism have been my constant support over all these
years; to my mother-in-law, Tatyana, whose belief in me-even in my craziest endeavors-has been
an incredible source of strength; and to my kids, Matvey and Milena: I hope you'll read it one day.
