Table 4.1: Vector store comparison by deployment options, licensing, and key features
Each vector store offers different tradeoffs in terms of deployment flexibility, licensing, and spe­
cialized capabilities. For production RAG systems, consider factors such as:
•
Whether you need cloud-managed or self-hosted deployment
•
The need for specific features like SQL integration or multi-modal support
•
The complexity of setup and maintenance
•
Scaling requirements for your expected embedding volume
