The gap in state tracking capabilities is particularly relevant. Despite theoretically unlimited con­
text windows, AI systems struggle with coherently tracking object states and agent knowledge
through complex scenarios. Humans, despite limited working memory capacity (typically 3-4
chunks according to more recent cognitive research), excel at tracking relevant states through
selective attention and effective information organization strategies.
While AI systems have made impressive strides in multimodal integration (text, images, audio,
video), they still lack the seamless cross-modal understanding that humans develop naturally.
Similarly, in creative generation, AI remains bounded by its training distribution, producing
variations on known patterns rather than fundamentally new concepts.
From an architectural perspective, the human brain's modular, hierarchical organization with
specialized subsystems enables remarkable energy efficiency (~20 watts) compared to AI's largely
homogeneous architectures requiring massive computational resources. Additionally, AI systems
can perpetuate and amplify biases present in their training data, raising ethical concerns beyond
performance limitations.
These differences suggest that while certain capabilities may improve through better training
data and techniques, others may require more fundamental architectural innovations to bridge
the gap between statistical pattern matching and genuine understanding.
Despite impressive advances in generative AI, fundamental gaps remain between human and AI
cognition across multiple dimensions. Most critically, AI lacks:
•
Real-world grounding for knowledge
•
Adaptive flexibility across contexts
•
Truly integrated understanding beneath surface fluency
•
Energy-efficient processing
•
Social and contextual awareness
These limitations aren't isolated issues but interconnected aspects of the same fundamental
challenges in developing truly human-like artificial intelligence. Alongside technical advances,
the regulatory landscape for AI is evolving rapidly, creating a complex global marketplace. The
European Union's AI Act, implemented in 2024, has created stringent requirements that have
delayed or limited the availability of some AI tools in European markets. For instance, Meta AI
became available in France only in 2025, two years after its US release, due to regulatory compli­
ance challenges. This growing regulatory divergence adds another dimension to the evolution
of AI beyond technical scaling, as companies must adapt their offerings to meet varying legal
requirements while maintaining competitive capabilities.
